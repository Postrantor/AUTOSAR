7. # Functional specification

   1. ## General description

The AUTOSAR Adaptive architecture organizes the software of the AUTOSAR Adaptive foundation as functional clusters. These clusters offer common functionality as services to the applications. The Communication Management (CM) for AUTOSAR Adaptive is such a functional cluster and is part of \"AUTOSAR Runtime for Adaptive Applications\" ARA. It is responsible for the construction and supervision of communication paths between applications, both local and remote.

The CM provides the infrastructure that enables communication between Adaptive AUTOSAR Applications within one machine and with software entities on other machines, e.g. other Adaptive AUTOSAR applications or Classic AUTOSAR SWCs. All communication paths can be established at design, start-upor run-time.

This specification includes the syntax of the API, the relationship of API to the model and describes semantics, e.g. through state machines, and assumption of pre-, postconditions and use of APIs. The specification does not provide constraints on the SW architecture of a platform implementation, so there is no definition of basic software modules and no specification of implementation or internal technical architecture of the Communication Management.

### Architectural concepts

The Communication management of AUTOSAR Adaptive can be logically divided into the following sub-parts:

- Language binding
- End-to-end communication protection
- Communication / Network binding
- Communication Management software

![](./media/image5.png)**Figure 7.1:** **Technical Architecture of Communication Management**

In the context of Communication Management, the following types of interfaces are defined:

- Public Application Interface: Part of the Adaptive AUTOSAR API and specified in the SWS. This is the standardized ara::com API.
- Functional Cluster Interactions: Interaction between functional clusters. Not normative, intended to make specification more readable and to support integration of SW into demonstrator. (dotted arrow in [7.1](#_bookmark3)) And also interactions between elements within a functional cluster. Not used in specifications, so it is a nonstandardized interface. Used for communication inside Communication Management software (grey arrow in [7.1](#_bookmark3))

Please note, that Language Binding and Communication Binding depend on a specific configuration by the integrator, but they need to be deployed within the application binary. This results in the fact that the serialization of the Communication Binding will run in the execution context of the Adaptive Application.

For the design of ARA API the following constraints apply:

- Support the independence of application software components
- Use of Service-oriented communication without dependency on a specific communication protocol
- Make the API as lean as possible, neither supporting very specific use cases which could also be done on top of the API, nor supporting component model or higher level concepts. The API is restricted to support core communication mechanisms.
- Support for dynamic communication:

  No discovery by application middleware, the clients know the server but the Server does not know the clients. Event subscription is the only dynamic communication pattern in the application.
  Full service discovery in the application. No communication paths are known at configuration time. An API for Service discovery allows the application code to choose the service instance.
- Support both Event/Callback and Polling style usage of the API to enable classic RTE style paradigms. To support high determinism demands in case of callbackbased / event-based interaction, there shall be the possibility to avoid uncontrolled context switches.
- Support both synchronous callback-based communication and asynchronous communication philosophy.
- Support of client/server communication.
- Support of sender/receiver communication with queued semantics where the receiver caches are configurable.
- Support of selection of trigger conditions for task activation.
- Extensions for security.
- Extensions for Quality Of Service QoS.
- Scalability for real-time systems.
- Support of built-in end-to-end communication protection, where a use-casespecific behavior can be done on top of ARA API.

  1. ### Design decisions

The design of the ARA API covers the following principles:

- It uses the Proxy/Skeleton pattern:

  The (service) proxy is the representative of the possibly remote (i.e. other process, other core, other node) service. It is an instance of a C++ class local to the application/client, which uses the service.
  The (service) skeleton is the connection of the user provided service implementation to the middleware transport infrastructure. Service implementation class is derived from the (service) skeleton.
  Beside proxies/skeletons, there might exist a so-called \"Runtime\" (singleton) class to provide some essentials to manage proxies and skeletons. But this is communication management software implementation specific and therefore not specified in this document, but may be specified in a future version.

Regarding proxy/skeleton design pattern in general and its role in middleware implementations, see [9] [10].

- It supports callback mechanisms on data reception.
- The API has zero-copy capabilities including the possibility for memory management in the middleware.
- It is aligned with the AUTOSAR service model (services, instances, events, methods, \...) to allow the generation of proxies and skeletons out of this model.
- Full discovery and service instance selection support on API level.
- Client/Server Communication uses concepts introduced by C++11 language, e.g. std::future, std::promise, to fully support method calls between different contexts.
- Abstract from SOME/IP specific behavior, but support SOME/IP service mechanisms, as methods, events and fields.
- Support/implement the standard end-to-end protection protocols, as specified in

[7] and [4].

- Support of Service contract versioning.
- Support Event and Polling style usage of the API equally to enable classic RT style paradigms.
- Fully exploit C++11/14 features in API design to provide usability and comfort for the application developer.

See ARAComAPI explanatory [1] for more details and explanations on the ARA API design.

### Communication paradigms

Service-Oriented Communication (SoC) as a part of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) [11] is the main communication pattern for Adaptive AUTOSAR Applications. It allows establishing communication paths both at run-time, so it can be used to build up dynamic communication with unknown number of participants. Figure [7.2](#_bookmark8) shows the basic operation principle of Service-Oriented Communication.

**Figure 7.2:** **Service-Oriented Communication**

Service Discovery decides whether external and internal service-oriented communication is established. The discovery strategy shall allow either returning a specific service instance or all available instances providing the requested service at the time of the request, no matter if they are available locally or remote. The Communication Management software should provide an optimized implementation for both the Service discovery and the communication connection, depending on the location where the service provider resides. More about Service Discovery can be found in *SOME/IP Service Discovery Protocol Specification* [12].

The service class is the central element of the Service-Oriented Communication pattern applied in Adaptive AUTOSAR. It represents the service by collecting the methods and events which are provided or requested by the applications implementing the concrete service functionality.

### Service contract versioning

In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environments the client and the provider of a service rely on a contract which covers the service interface and behavior. The interface and the behavior of a service may change over time. Therefore, service contract versioning has been introduced to differentiate between the different versions of a service.

![](./media/image6.jpeg){width="5.627187226596676in" height="1.5709372265966755in"}

**Figure 7.3: Service contract versioning over time**

The AUTOSAR Adaptive platform supports service contract versioning. The service contract versioning is separated between the design phase and the deployment phase. This means that any service at design level may have its own version number which is mapped to a version number of the used network binding and vice versa. The mapping process is manually done by the service designer or integrator.

![](./media/image7.jpeg){width="6.290103893263342in" height="4.225in"}

**Figure 7.4: Service contract versioning flow**

Note:

1. The contract version of a ServiceInterface consists of a majorVersion and a minorVersion number. The majorVersion number indicates backwardsincompatible service changes. The minorVersion number indicates backwardscompatible service changes.

   for backwards-incompatible interface or behavior changes the majorVersion

number is increased and the minorVersion number is set to 0.

- for backwards-compatible interface or behavior changes the majorVersion

number is unchanged and the minorVersion number is increased.

2. The contract version of a ServiceInterface is mapped to a version of the ServiceInterfaceDeployment. This version mapping may be done several times resulting in several ServiceInterfaceDeployments for the same ServiceInterface. Such a mapping will result in unambiguous identification on each VLAN according to the [constr_1723] in [6].

**[SWS_CM_99003]**{DRAFT} *[*The version of ServiceInterfaceDeployment shall be evaluated by the Service Discovery in terms of backwards-compatibility based on the used network binding for service connection.*â™©(RS_CM_00500, RS_CM_00501, RS_CM_00700)*

1. ## Raw Data Streaming

   1. ### Raw Data Streaming Interface

In some cases it is necessary for the application software to be able to process raw binary data streams sent over a communication channel. In a raw binary data stream the data is not typed, and is handled as a continuing sequence of bytes. So serialization of the data is not necessary. This section specifies an interface as part of ara::com to support processing of raw binary data streams, as an alternative to SOME/IP.

The interface is statically defined and independent of the underlying network protocol. However, currently the modeling for the Raw Data Streaming Interface only supports TCP/IP sockets as transport layer. Both unicast and multicast socket connections shall be supported. The sockets can use both TCP or UDP as transport protocol. TCP is the natural choice for RawDataStreams since it is a reliable stream oriented protocol. However, UDP shall also be supported when an unreliable connection is acceptable for the application.

The operations of the interface are synchronous. The default behavior is blocking, but a timeout handling shall be implemented to return the call with an error if the operation takes too long. The timeout values are applied as parameters to each operation. See the description for each operation below on how the timeout handling is applied.

The integration of the Raw Data Streaming Interface and Adaptive Applications is done in the deployment phase, by specifying various attributes and parameters for the socket connections that shall be used for the Raw Data Stream, using RawDataStreamMapping and EthernetRawDataStreamMapping. The model and the parameters are described in *TPS_ManifestSpecification* [6].

Secure communication can be achieved by applying TLS or IPSec protocols in the middleware. Also access control imposed by the IAM can be applied for Raw Data

Streams. All security functions are configurable in the deployment and mapping model of Raw Data Streaming Interface, see *TPS_ManifestSpecification* [6].

For safety critical applications wanting to use RawDataStreaming, a safety analysis needs to be done by the application developer, to find relevant communication faults for the stream data. If a protection of data exchange algorithm is needed, such as E2E protection, this will not be provided in the RawDataStream interface, but is to be implemented in the application layer that is using the RawDataStream interface. This is because only raw data with no data type information is transferred over the RawDataStream.

An application can use the Raw Data Streaming API both as a client (connecting to a listening Raw Data Streaming service) or server (waiting for incoming connections from clients).

Figure [7.5](#_bookmark12) shows the logical view of the usage of RawDataStream instances.

![](./media/image8.jpeg){width="6.046874453193351in" height="3.276561679790026in"}

**Figure 7.5:** **Raw Data Stream Logical View.**

### Limitations

The current solution does not support any runtime variance in terms of network topology, such as service discovery functionality, which means that the RawDataStreams has to be configured statically on the same ECU as the application. Dynamic configuration and runtime functionality will be added in future releases if needed.

The multicast support is limited to one-to-many, i.e. a server can send data to multiple clients using multicast, but only receive data from one client, using the unicast

address. Also multicast shall only be used with UDP. For TCP connections, only 1-to-1 connections are supported, i.e. multiple clients to one server is not supported.

### Use cases

The RawDataStream interface can be used in the following set-ups:

- Client (connect to) to an external non-AUTOSAR sensor providing raw data on a socket connection.
- Server (wait for a connection from) for an external non-AUTOSAR sensor providing raw data on a socket connection.
- Client or Server for another AUTOSAR external RawDataStream instance.

RawDataStream socket connections can be setup for UDP or TCP, Unicast or Multicast. Currently the use cases in fig [7.6](#_bookmark15) are supported.

**Figure 7.6:** **The currently supported use cases for Raw Data Streams, and which artifacts in the Deployment model that shall be used to configure the different use cases**

### Raw Data Streaming

For the Raw Data Stream C++ API reference, see chapter 8.1.3.21.

**[SWS_CM_10476] Defining a RawDataStream** *[*To open a RawDataStream connection a RawDataStream instance is created. The constructor creates the necessary socket data structures for RawDataStream Communication, using the artifacts specified in the mapped EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping and EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

### [SWS_CM_99004] {DRAFT} Ethernet endpoint configuration *[*

Ethernet socket connections are statically configured in the Deployment model as part of the Service Instance Manifest, and used throughout the connected session for the RawDataStreams communication. The following configuration elements can be specified on the Deployment model of each RawDataStreamClient or RawDataStreamServer instance, identified through the InstanceSpecifier provided to the constructor.

RawDataStreamClient endpoint and credentials configuration elements:

- Local Network Endpoint: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.localCommConnector
- Local UdpPort: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.localUdpPort
- Local TcpPort: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.localTcpPort
- Socket Options: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.socketOption
- (D)TLS properties: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.tlsSecureComProps
- Remote Unicast Credentials: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping. unicastCredentials (UDP/TCP)
- Multicast Credentials: EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.multicastCredentials (UDP only)

RawDataStreamServer endpoint and credentials configuration elements:

- Local Network Endpoint: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.localCommConnector
- Local UdpPort: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.localUdpPort
- Local TcpPort: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.localTcpPort
- Socket Options: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.socketOption
- (D)TLS properties: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.tlsSecureComProps
- Remote Unicast Credentials: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping. unicastUdpCredentials (UDP only)
- Multicast Credentials: EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping.multicastCredentials (UDP only)

For the RawDataStreamClients the following shall apply:

- Remote server credentials for unicast communication must always be defined for the client. The Unicast remote server credentials are configured in RawDataStreamEthernetTcpUdpCredentials aggregated by the EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping in the role unicastCredentials.
- A tcpPort and udpPort shall not be defined in the same RawDataStreamEthernetTcpUdpCredentials element.
- If a TcpPort is defined in the EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping.unicastCredentials, these credentials are used for Connect() calls to establish the connection to the server.
- This unicast connection shall always be used for WriteData() calls to send data to the server (for both UDP and TCP).
- If Multicast Credentials are defined for the client, the RawDataStream shall bind and join the multicast address and udpPort given in the MulticastCredentials. The MulticastCredentials is configured in RawDataStreamEthernetUdpCredentials aggregated by the EthernetRawDataStreamClientMapping. This multicast socket connection shall be read from when ReadData() is called.
- If no MulticastCredentials are defined for the client, the Unicast Remote Credentials shall also be used for ReadData() calls.

For the RawDataStreamServers the following shall apply:

- If Multicast Credentials is defined for the server, a multicast connection shall be created using the Multicast Credentials which are configured in RawDataStreamEthernetUdpCredentials aggregated by the EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping in the role multicastCredentials. Then the data is sent on this multicast socket when WriteData() is called.
- If Remote Unicast Credentials are defined for the server, a unicast socket shall be created using the Unicast Credentials which are configured in RawDataStreamEthernetUdpCredentials aggregated by the EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping in the role unicastUdpCredentials. Then the data is sent on this unicast socket when WriteData() is called.
- The local credentials defined in EthernetCommunicationConnector shall always be used to create a unicast socket and read data from a client when ReadData() is called on the server side. If no local credentials are defined, reading of data from the server cannot be performed, and an error kStreamNotConnected will be returned.
- If a localTcpPort is defined in EthernetRawDataStreamServerMapping, the credentials defined in EthernetCommunicationConnector are used to create, bind, and listen to the socket used for TCP communication when the constructor of RawDataStream is called. Then the server accepts incoming connection requests when WaitForConnection() is called.

**[SWS_CM_90216]**{DRAFT} **Socket Options configuration** *[*For both RawDataStreamClients and RawDataStreamServers a list of socket options can be defined in the attribute socketOption to be applied to the sockets created for unicast or multicast communication. The options shall be specified as a list of strings. The accepted values are platform specific and shall be documented by the vendor.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

An example of socketOption definition is to provide a series of \"option\", \"value\" pairs for POSIX socket level options, e.g.: [\"SO_KEEPALIVE\", \"1\", SO_RCVBUF\",\"1024\"]

**[SWS_CM_90217]**{DRAFT} **TLS properties configuration** *[*For both RawDataStreamClients and RawDataStreamServers (D)TLS properties can be defined in the attributes tlsSecureComProps to configure usage of TLS to create secure UDP and TCP channels for the RawDataStreams according to the Transport Layer Security protocol. See [[SWS_CM_90211](#_bookmark302)]*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411)*

Note: Usage of (D)TLS is restricted to 1:1 socket connections (use case 1 and 2 of figure [Figure](#_bookmark15) [7.6](#_bookmark15)).

The functionality of a RawDataStream for Client communication is realized in these four operations: Connect, Shutdown, ReadData and WriteData. A RawDataStream for Server Communication is realized in these four operations: WaitForConnection, Shutdown, ReadData and WriteData.

**[SWS_CM_10477] Connect stream link** *[*Each invocation of the Connect operation for a TCP socket connection shall establish a communication link with a remote server that is listening for socket connections, The socket created in the RawDataStream instance shall be used for the connection. For UDP socket connections Connect shall do nothing.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

**[SWS_CM_99005]**{DRAFT} **Wait for incoming connections** *[*Each invocation of the WaitForConnection operation shall wait for and accept incoming requests for establishment of a TCP communication link with a connecting remote client. The socket created and prepared in the RawDataStream instance shall be used for the connection. For UDP socket connections WaitForConnection shall do nothing.*â™©(RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

**[SWS_CM_10478] Shutdown stream link** *[*Each invocation of the Shutdown operation shall destroy the communication link for the stream.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

**[SWS_CM_10479] Read data from stream** *[*Each invocation of the ReadData operation shall request to read a number of bytes from the stream. The read data shall be

moved to a buffer returned as result from the function, together with the actual number of bytes transferred.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

**[SWS_CM_10480] Write data to stream** *[*Each invocation of the WriteData operation shall request to write a number of bytes to the stream and send it out on the socket connection. The actual number of bytes transferred shall be returned. It shall be possible to apply a timeout value for the operation. The operation shall write the data to the socket or internal buffer, and then return with the number of bytes written. For efficiency, the Write operation does not wait until data is actually sent on the bus, but the TCP data flow handling shall make sure that data is transmitted and received in the correct order. For UDP connections the order cannot be guaranteed.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411, RS_CM_00412)*

**[SWS_CM_99006]**{DRAFT} **Timeout handling** *[*For all Connect, WaitForConnection, Read and Write RawDataStream operations a timeout value can be specified via a parameter in runtime. If no timeout parameter is given the operation shall block. If a timeout value is specified, and the operation does not finish within the specified time, an error code RawErrc::kCommunicationTimeout shall be returned and the technical state of the RawDataStream connection shall be restored to the same as before the call was made.*â™©(RS_CM_00410, RS_CM_00411)*

## Communication Group

The Communication Group is a communication concept based on ara::com which is designed for Adaptive State Management applications. It can be seen as a composite Service which manages information routing in a defined manner. A Communication Group has one server and multiple clients. The server is able to send broadcast and peer to peer messages to the clients of a Communication Group. The clients can acknowledge these messages. The server of a Communication Group can further verify how many clients are connected to the Communication Group at every time. Applications can connect/disconnect to a Communication Group instance using one of the two Communication Group Service Interfaces, CommunicationGroupServer or CommunicationGroupClient.

### Connection

The connection and disconnection to Communication Group is performed by standard

ara::com functions.

### Communication Group Server

The Server of a Communication Group connects to a Communication Group by connecting to the CommunicationGroupServer Service of this Communication group (using FindService or StartFindService).

**[SWS_CM_99016]**{DRAFT} **Connection Status of a Communication Group Server** *[*The Server of the Communication Group shall be considered to be connected if the server has successfully subscribed to the response message response event of the CommunicationGroupServer Service, else the Server shall be considered not connected.*â™©(RS_CM_00600, RS_CM_00601)*

### Communication Group Client

A Communication Group client connects to a Communication Group by offering the CommunicationGroupClient Service. A Communication Group client disconnects to a Communication Group by stop offering the CommunicationGroupClient Service.

### Limitations

The Communication Group concept has the following limitations:

- There is only one Server for an instance of a Communication Group at a given time.
- A Client provides the CommunicationGroupClient Service to only one instance of a Communication Group at a given time.

The figure below outlines a connection example for a Communication Group.

### Communication Group Creation

A Communication Group is created by defining a Communication Group template

only.

**[SWS_CM_99020]**{DRAFT} **Communcation Group template** *[*The Communication Group template is a ServiceInterface of type CommunicationGroupClient with the category value COMMUNICATION_GROUP. It shall be used to define a Communication Group, where:

- The SHORT-NAME of this template shall define of the name of the Communication Group.
- The event definition according to [[SWS_CM_99009](#_bookmark24)] shall define the data type of the message responses of the Communication Group.
- The method definition according to [[SWS_CM_99008](#_bookmark23)] shall define the data type of the messages of the Communication Group.

*â™©(RS_CM_00600, RS_CM_00601)*

Based on the Communication Group template [[SWS_CM_99020](#_bookmark32)] the ServiceInterfaces for the CommunicationGroupServer [[SWS_CM_99000](#_bookmark20)] and the CommunicationGroupClient [[SWS_CM_99007](#_bookmark22)] can be generated/derived.

**[SWS_CM_99021]**{DRAFT} **SHORT-NAME value of generated CommunicationGroupServer service** *[*The SHORT-NAME value of generated Communication-

GroupServer service shall be the SHORT-NAME of the according Communication Group template concatenated by the name Server.*â™©(RS_CM_00600, RS_CM_00601)*

The figures below outline the Communication Group creation flow.

The Communication Group Template defines the name of the Communication Group and defines the message and message response datatypes.

## Optional Execution Context

Some ara::com API's with an asynchronous callback allow the use of an optional execution context parameter (see [[SWS_CM_11352](#_bookmark553)], [[SWS_CM_11352](#_bookmark553)], [[SWS_CM_11354](#_bookmark564)], [[SWS_CM_11356](#_bookmark574)], [[SWS_CM_11358](#_bookmark571)], [[SWS_CM_11360](#_bookmark544)],

[[SWS_CM_11362](#_bookmark547)]). The execution context parameter gives the user more control over the execution environment of a method call.

**[SWS_CM_11364]**{DRAFT} **Minimal behaviour of provided Execution Context** *[*An optionally provided execution context executor shall:

- execute every function that it was passed to.
- execute each function it was passed to only once.

*â™©(RS_CM_00204)*

## Network binding

The following chapters describe the requirements according to specific network protocol bindings.

Since the selection of a particular network protocol binding is an integrator driven deployment decision, any change in the selection of a particular network protocol binding or changes in the various attributes and parameters of a particular network protocol

binding shall be possible without requiring a re-compilation of the involved adaptive applications. The required changes to the involved adaptive application shall be limited to a re-linking (either static or dynamic) of the involved adaptive application.

**[SWS_CM_10384]**{DRAFT} **Change of Service Interface Deployment** *[*A change of the service interface deployment shall be possible without re-compiling the involved adaptive applications. -This means that the following changes in the service interface deployment shall be possible without the need for a re-compilation of the adaptive applications:

- changes to the concrete type of ServiceInterfaceDeployment and the composed ServiceMethodDeployment, ServiceFieldDeployment, and ServiceEventDeployment (e.g., changing a SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment to a UserDefinedServiceInterfaceDeployment)
- changes to one or more attributes of meta-classes derived from ServiceInterfaceDeployment, ServiceMethodDeployment, ServiceFieldDeployment, and ServiceEventDeployment (e.g., changing the value of SomeipEventDeployment.separationTime)
- backwards-compatible changes to the technology specific service version number of the ServiceInterfaceDeployment.

*â™©(RS_CM_00315)*

Note that changes to SomeipServiceVersion.majorVersion are an exception here, since any change to SomeipServiceVersion.majorVersion indicates an incompatible change of the ServiceInterface and thus affects the involved adaptive applications mandating a re-compilation of the involved adaptive applications.

**[SWS_CM_10385]**{DRAFT} **Change of Service Instance Deployment** *[*A change of the service instance deployment shall be possible without re-compiling the involved adaptive applications. -This means that the following changes in the service instance deployment shall be possible without the need for a re-compilation of the adaptive applications:

- changes to the concrete type of ProvidedApServiceInstance and/or RequiredApServiceInstance (e.g., changing a ProvidedSomeipServiceInstance to a ProvidedUserDefinedServiceInstance and a RequiredSomeipServiceInstance to a RequiredUserDefinedServiceInstance)
- changes to one or more attributes of meta-class derived from ProvidedApServiceInstance and/or RequiredApServiceInstance (e.g., changing the value of the SomeipProvidedEventGroup.multicastThreshold or the SomeipSdServerServiceInstanceConfig.serviceOfferTimeToLive).
- backwards-compatible changes to the technology specific service version number of the ServiceInterfaceDeployment.

*â™©(RS_CM_00315)* Note that changes to SomeipServiceVersion.majorVersion are an exception here, since any change to SomeipServiceVersion.majorVersion indicates an incompatible change of the ServiceInterface and thus affects

the involved adaptive applications mandating a re-compilation of the involved adaptive applications.

**[SWS_CM_10386]**{DRAFT} **Change of Network Configuration** *[*A change of the network configuration shall be possible without re-compiling the involved adaptive applications. -This means that the following changes in the network configuration shall be possible without the need for a re-compilation of the adaptive applications:

- changes to one or more attributes of a concrete ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping (e.g., changing the value of the SomeipServiceInstanceToMachineMapping.udpPort or the SomeipServiceInstanceToMachineMapping.tcpPort.

*â™©(RS_CM_00315)*

Abstract network protocol bindings for service ports shall be specified inside the service instance manifest to deploy network bindings of service instances.

**[SWS_CM_10590]**{DRAFT} **Abstract Network Protocol Binding** *[*The usage of abstract network protocol binding for ProvidedApServiceInstance and RequiredApServiceInstance shall be supported to deploy network bindings of ServiceInterfaces. An abstract network protocol binding shall cover SOME/IP, DDS and UserDefined protocols and is specified inside the service instance manifest. It is used with an InstanceSpecifier and shall be specified as followed:

\<port context\>::\<port name\>, where:

- \<port context\> specifies the instantiation context of the port which might be an instantiation path or any other unique identifiable information.
- \<port name\> specifies the port name.

Note: it is possible to specify multiple technology bindings for a port (Multi-Binding).*â™©*

*(RS_CM_00200, RS_AP_00137)*

**[SWS_CM_10416]**{DRAFT} **Reception of a malformed message** *[*In case any network binding does receive a message, which it identifies as malformed, the message shall be discarded and the error shall not be propagated to the application.*â™©(RS_CM_00005)*

Note: The incident should also be logged if logging is configured and the corresponding network binding supports it.

### SOME/IP Network binding

SOME/IP supports different kind of bindings:

### SOME/IP Events:

- uni-cast is one-to-one communication
- multi-cast is one-to-many communication

In case the active subscriptions will reach the multi-cast-threshold the communication paradigm will be switched from uni-cast to multi-cast to gain a better network utilization. Below the multi-cast-threshold SOME/IP is maintaining for a subscription a single unicast communication.

### SOME/IP Events:

- many-to-one communication using multiple uni-cast communications

**[SWS_CM_10000] SOME/IP Compliance** *[*The SOME/IP network binding shall implement the SOME/IP Protocol and the SOME/IP Service Discovery Protocol defined in

### Service Discovery

**[SWS_CM_11374] Periodic link state monitoring** *[*The SOME/IP network binding shall periodically monitor and obtain the current link state of the underlying network interfaces.

Note: This information is required since the behavior of SOME/IP service discovery is influenced by the current link state as well as by changes in the link state*â™©()*

**[SWS_CM_00201] Start of service discovery protocol on Server side** *[*The registration of a new offered service which is bound to SOME/IP by invoking the OfferService method (see [[SWS_CM_00101](#_bookmark522)]) of the ServiceSkeleton class shall trigger the start of the initial wait phase of the SOME/IP service discovery protocol after link up according to [PRS_SOMEIPSD_00133].*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00101, RS_SOMEIPSD_00024, RS_SOMEIPSD_00013)*

In this case all event and method messages that are configured for data accumulation shall be aggregated in a buffer until a transmission trigger (see [[SWS_CM_10389](#_bookmark52)] and [[SWS_CM_10390](#_bookmark53)]) arrives and the data transmission starts.*â™©(RS_CM_00204)*

- a SOME/IP message needs to be transmitted for which the udpCollectionTrigger is set to always.
- the udpCollectionBufferTimeout is reached for one of the SOME/IP message already aggregated in the buffer.
- the buffer size defined by the attribute udpCollectionBufferSizeThreshold is reached.
- adding the method response or event to the buffer would lead to a message larger than the maximum possible size (e.g. MTU size). In this case the actual buffer shall be triggered before handling the new event or method response.

*â™©(RS_CM_00204)*

In the following sections the term \"sending of a SOME/IP message shall be requested\" will be used to describe the fact that the sending of the message is requested but may be deferred due to data accumulation for UDP data transmission according to [[SWS_CM_10388](#_bookmark51)], [[SWS_CM_10389](#_bookmark52)], and [[SWS_CM_10390](#_bookmark53)].

### Execution context of message reception actions

In the following sections the term \"upon reception\" will be used to describe the fact that certain actions (e.g, the deserialization of the payload according to [[SWS_CM_10294](#_bookmark65)]) will be performed at a point in time between the actual reception of a message and the call of the corresponding API (e.g., the GetNewSamples (see [[SWS_CM_00701](#_bookmark570)]) method of the respective Event class). This specification deliberately does not explicitly state whether these actions will be performed in the context of message reception, in the context of the API call, or in a completely seperate execution context to leave room for potential optimizations of a concrete ara::com implementation.

The only restriction imposed here refers to the execution context of the EventReceiveHandler (see [[SWS_CM_00309](#_bookmark481)]). -Executing the EventReceiveHandler in the context of the GetNewSamples (see [[SWS_CM_00701](#_bookmark570)]) method is not allowed,

since according to [[SWS_CM_00181](#_bookmark573)] the EventReceiveHandlershall use the GetNewSamples method to access the retrieved event data.

**[SWS_CM_11270]**{DRAFT} **Selecting elements of the ServiceInterface for SecOC transmission** *[*It is possible to define which elements of the ServiceInterface of the particular AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance shall be securedby SecOC. The selection of ServiceInterface elements is done by the ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfigthat is aggregated by AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance.

The following configuration in the ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfig

is applicable:

- ### Methods

The roles methodCall and methodReturn identify the method(s) that shall be sprotected by SecOC with the configuration settings that are available in the ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfig element.

- ### Events

The role event identifies the event(s) that shall be protected by SecOC with the configuration settings that are availble in the ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfig element.

- ### Fields

The roles fieldNotifier, getterCall, getterReturn, setterCall and setterReturn identify the field content that shall be protected by SecOC with the configuration settings that are available in the ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfig element.

This attribute defines the memory alignment. The SOME/IP network binding does not try to automatically align parameters but aligns as specified. The alignment is currently constraint to multiple of 1 Byte to simplify code generators.

SOME/IP payload should be placed in memory so that the SOME/IP payload is suitable aligned. For infotainment ECUs an alignment of 8 Bytes (i.e. 64 bits) should be achieved, for all ECU at least an alignment of 4 Bytes should be achieved. An efficient alignment is highly hardware dependent.

### Structured Data Types (structs)

**[SWS_CM_10042] Serializing a struct Data Type** *[*A Structure Cpp Implementation Data Type shall be serialized in order of depth-first traversal.*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00201, RS_CM_00202, RS_CM_00211)*

The SOME/IP network binding doesn't automatically align parameters of a struct.

Insert reserved/padding elements into the AUTOSAR data type if needed for alignment, since the SOME/IP network binding shall not automatically add such padding.

So if for example a struct includes a std::uint8_t and a std::uint32_t, they are just written sequentially into the buffer. This means that there is no padding between the uint8 and the first byte of the std::uint32_t; therefore, the std::uint32_t might not be aligned. So the system designer has to consider to add padding elements to the data type to achieve the required alignment or set it globally.

Warning about unaligned structs or similar shall not be done in the SOME/IP network binding but only in the tool chain used to generate the SOME/IP network binding.

The SOME/IP network binding does not automatically insert dummy/padding elements.

SOME/IP allows to add a length field of 8, 16 or 32 bit in front of structs. The length field of a struct describes the number of bytes of the struct. This allows for extensible structs which allow better migration of interfaces.

### Structured Datatypes and Arguments with Identifier and optional Members

To achieve enhanced forward and backward compatibility, an additional Data ID can be added in front of struct members or method arguments. The receiver then can skip unknown members/arguments, i.e. where the Data ID is unknown. New members/arguments can be added at arbitrary positions when Data IDs are transferred in the serialized byte stream.

Structs are modeled in the Manifest using CppImplementationDataType of category STRUCTURE and members are represented by CppImplementationDataTypeElements. Method arguments are represented by ArgumentDataPrototypes.

The assignment of Data IDs is modeled in the Manifest in the context of TransformationPropsToServiceInterfaceElementMapping. Refer to [6] for more details.

Moreover, the usage of Data IDs allows describing structs with optional members. Whether a member is optional or not, is defined in the Manifest using the attribute CppImplementationDataTypeElement.isOptional.

Whether an optional member is actually present in the struct or not, is to be determined during runtime. This is realized in the Adaptive Platform using the ara::core::Optional class template (see [8.1.2.6.3](#optional-data-types) Optional Data Types).

In addition to the Data ID, a wire type encodes the datatype of the following member. Data ID and wire type are encoded in a so-called tag.

For more details, please refer to [5].

**[SWS_CM_90443] Wire type for non-dynamic data types** *[*If TransformationPropsToServiceInterfaceElementMapping.transformationProps. isDynamicLengthFieldSize is set to false or is not defined, the serializer shall use wire type 4 for serializing complex types and shall use the fixed size length fields.

**[SWS_CM_90444] Wire type for dynamic data types** *[*If TransformationPropsToServiceInterfaceElementMapping.transformationProps.isDynamicLengthFieldSize is set to true, the transformer shall use wire types 5,6,7 for serializing complex types and shall chose the size of the length field according to this wire type.*â™©(RS_CM_00204)*

**[SWS_CM_90445] A deserializer shall always be able to handle the wire types 4, 5, 6 and 7** *[*A deserializer shall always be able to handle the wire types 4, 5, 6 and 7 independent of the setting of TransformationPropsToServiceInterfaceElementMapping.transformationProps.isDynamicLengthFieldSize.*â™© (RS_CM_00204)*

Note: regarding existence of Data IDs, refer to [6]. Note: regarding existence of length field, refer to [5].

Rationale: The length field is required to skip unknown members/arguments during deserialization.

### Vectors and arrays

SOME/IP supports arrays with static and dynamic length but there is no definition of vectors on this abstraction level. Therefore, vectors are mapped to arrays with dynamic length. The SOME/IP specification requires to add a length field of 8, 16 or 32 bit in front of data structures with dynamic length. The length field of arrays describes the total number of bytes. Note that this section uses only the term array which can also be used to realize vectors.

The layout of arrays with dynamic length is shown in [7.16](#_bookmark144) and Figure [7.17](#_bookmark145) where L_1 and L_2 denote the length in bytes. The serialization of oneand multi-dimensional dynamic length arrays is described in the next two subchapters.

### One-dimensional

A one-dimensional array carries a number of elements of the same type.

**Figure 7.16:** **One-dimensional arrays (Example)**

**[SWS_CM_10070] Serializing one-dimentional array** *[*A one-dimensional array shall be serialized by concatenating the arrays elements in order.*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00201, RS_CM_00202, RS_CM_00211)*

**Figure 7.17:** **Multi-dimensional arrays (Example)**

In case of multi-dimensional dynamic length arrays, each array (serialized as SOME/IP array) needs to have its own length field. See L_1 and L_2 in Figure [7.17](#_bookmark145).

### Associative Maps

Associative map is modeled as StdCppImplementationDataType with category ASSOCIATIVE_MAP in the Manifest. As stated in the AUTOSAR Manifest Specification [6] the "natural" language binding in C++ for an associative map is ara::core::Map\<key_type,value_type\> where key_type is the data type used for the key of a map element and value_type is the data type for the value of a map element. Hereby key_type and value_type are derived from defined CppTemplateArguments aggregated by the Associative Map Cpp Implementation Data Type. Please see [SWS_LBAP_00023] for more details.

**[SWS_CM_10261] Serialization of an associative map** *[*As far as serialization is concerned the serialized representation of an associative map shall consist of the following parts without any intermediate padding:

**[SWS_CM_10266] Applicability of mandatory padding after variable length data elements** *[*Any mandatory padding (see [TPS_MANI_03107] and [TPS_MANI_03073]) after variable length data elements (see [[TPS_MANI_03103], [TPS_MANI_03104], [TPS_MANI_03117] and [TPS_MANI_03105]) shall be applied after the serialized key attribute as well as after the value attribute in case the respective attributes is typed by a variable length data type. This requirement does not apply for the serialization of extensible structs and methods.*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00201, RS_CM_00202, RS_CM_00211)* (see chapter [7.5.1.9.4](#structured-data-types-structs))

Note: Adhering to [[SWS_CM_10266](#_bookmark148)] is essential to ensure interoperability with the AUTOSAR classic platform where maps may be modelled as ApplicationArrayDataType with a dynamicArraySizeProfile of VSA_LINEAR where each array element is an ApplicationRecordDataType of variable length and thus [TPS_SYST_02126] applies to the individual ApplicationRecordElements.

### Variants

A Variant (type-safe union) can contain different types of elements. For example, if one defines a Variant of type uint8 and type uint16, the Variant shall carry an element of uint8 or uint16. When using different types of elements the alignment of subsequent parameters may be distorted. To resolve this, padding might be needed.

**[SWS_CM_10088] Serialization layout of Variants** *[*The default serialization layout of Variants are specified by the union data type in SOME/IP which is shown in Table [7.3](#_bookmark151).*â™©(RS_CM_00201, RS_CM_00202, RS_CM_00211)*

**Table 7.3: Default serialization layout of unions (Variants)**

SOME/IP allows to add a length field of 8, 16 or 32 bit in front of unions (Variants). The length field of a union (Variant) describes the number of bytes in the union (Variant).

This allows the deserializing network binding to quickly calculate the position where the data after the union (Variant) begin in the serialized data stream. This gets necessary if the union (Variant) contains data which are larger than expected, for example if a struct was extended with appended new members and only the first \"old\" members are deserialized by the SOME/IP network binding.

**[SWS_CM_10254] Variant length field** *[*If attribute sizeOfUnionLengthField of ApSomeipTransformationProps is set to a value greater 0, a length field shall be inserted in front of the serialized Variant for which the ApSomeipTransformationProps is defined.*â™©(RS_CM_00201, RS_CM_00202, RS_CM_00211)*

**[SWS_CM_10255] Variant length field data type** *[*If ApSomeipTransformationProps.sizeOfUnionLengthField is present for a Variant specified the data type of the length field for the Variant shall be determined by the value of ApSomeipTransformationProps.sizeOfUnionLengthField:

- *uint32* if sizeOfUnionLengthField equals 4

Note: If burstSize is set on receiver side it can be used to optimize buffer handling for reception of bursts.

### Marker Interface

On the AUTOSAR adaptive platform there are use-cases for the utilization of a ServiceInterface that does not have any method, event, or field defined. In other words, the existence of a ServiceInterface by itself represents a valid semantics that has a value on its own.

A service instance that corresponds to such a ServiceInterface may be offered with the mere intention to signal that the ECU that provides the service instance is becoming ready for something. So the SOME/IP Service Discovery mechanism is used to indicate the readiness. But for the communication not SOME/IP but a different protocol will be used.

For example an ECU may indicate with a service offer that it is ready to being diagnosed. A tester could then take the existence of the offer as an indication to initiate a connection to the respective ECU.

**[SWS_CM_10458] Handling of an ServiceInterface that does not contain any events, methods, or fields** *[*If a SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment is defined for a ServiceInterface that does not contain any events, methods, or fields and a ProvidedSomeipServiceInstance is defined in the ServiceInstanceManifest that points to the SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment in the role serviceInterface then:

- the ServiceInterface shall be offered over SOME/IP as defined by [[SWS_CM_00203](#_bookmark45)] which means that the Endpoint Option shall include the IP-Address, Port Number and Protocol as defined by the ProvidedSomeipServiceInstance
- the Server shall not create a UDP/TCP socket and shall not bind any socket to the configured server address

*â™©(RS_CM_00101)*

### Signal-Based Network binding

The applications on the adaptive platform communicate with each other in a serviceoriented manner. When exchanging information with software components executed on an AUTOSAR classic platform which make use of signal-based communication, a conversion between this signal-based communication and the service-oriented communication needs to take place. Hereby the signals of a received signal-based communication is being made available as elements of a provided ServiceInterface. The signals of a sent signal-based communication are being made available as elements of a required ServiceInterface. The conversion between signal-based communication and service-oriented communication may be performed by a software component on an AUTOSAR classic platform gateway ECU or by an adaptive application on an AUTOSAR adaptive platform Machine.

There are two approaches how the signal-based information is made available at the adaptive AUTOSAR Machine:

- Network binding (see section [7.5.2.1](#signal-based-someip-network-binding))
- Network binding (see section [7.5.2.2](#signal-based-static-network-binding))

  1. ### Signal-Based SOME/IP Network binding

The [Signal-Based SOME/IP](#_bookmark159) network binding is currently a specialization of the SOME/IP network binding and many aspects of the SOME/IP network binding are re-used. Instead of replicating many specification items from the SOME/IP network binding the approach of this [Signal-Based SOME/IP](#_bookmark159) network binding chapter is to replicate the chapter structure. Specification items which are applicable to the [Sig-](#_bookmark159) [nal-Based SOME/IP](#_bookmark159) network binding are just referenced, specification items which are NOT applicable to the [Signal-Based SOME/IP](#_bookmark159) network binding are explicitly ex-

cluded (via reference), and changed specification items are marked and the origin is referenced.

One major difference between the SOME/IP network binding and the [Signal-Based](#_bookmark159) [SOME/IP](#_bookmark159) network binding is the serialization technology. While the SOME/IP network binding only supports SOME/IP serialized payload the [Signal-Based SOME/IP](#_bookmark159) network binding supports the signal-based serialization of Classic platform COM-Stack as well as the SOME/IP serialization of payload (in order to support mixed use-cases).

**[SWS_CM_11269]**{DRAFT} **Definition of serialization technology** *[*The serialization technology is defined by the attribute SomeipEventDeployment.serializer. If the attribute is set to signalBased then the signal-service-translation is responsible for the handling of the serialization. If the attribute is set to someip then the SOME/IP serializer is responsible for the handling of the serialization.*â™©(RS_CM_00204)*

See also chapter [7.5.2.1.8](#serialization-of-payload-1) and chapter [7.5.1.9](#serialization-of-payload).

In figure [7.18](#_bookmark162) an example of a mixed serialized service is illustrated. The event *x* is defined to use someip serializer while event *y* is defined to use signalBased serializer. Both are part of one service and share the service discovery and general event handling.


![](./media/image33.png)**Figure 7.18:** **Example serialization settings**

The modeling of the signal-based communication and the mapping between the individual elements of a ServiceInterface to the corresponding ISignalTriggerings is defined in the chapter "Signal-based communication" in [6].

**[SWS_CM_10174]**{DRAFT} **Mix of signal-based and SOME/IP communication** *[*A combination of signal-based network binding and SOME/IP network binding shall be possible in a way to support the reception of a mix of signal-based communication and SOME/IP communication within a single UDP datagram or a single TCP stream on one UDP/TCP socket. Such a mix can occur when using [17] with enabled PDU-header option on the sender side.*â™©(RS_CM_00204)*

This allows to define the transport of messages from several services on the same socket, regardless of the serialization setting. Thus messages using the pure SOME/IP network binding can be transported together with messages using the signal-based network binding on the same socket.

Also one service which consists of events with different serialization technologies (i.e. someip and signalBased) shall be able to be transported on the same socket (this is covered by the signal-based network binding).

**[SWS_CM_10518]**{DRAFT} **Conditions for sending of a trigger** *[*The sending of an trigger shall be requested by invoking the Send method of the respective Trigger class (see [[SWS_CM_00721](#_bookmark535)] if there is at least one active subscriber and the offer of the service containing the trigger has not been stopped (either because the TTL contained in the SOME/IP OfferService message (see [[SWS_CM_00203](#_bookmark45)]) has expired or because the StopOfferService method (see [[SWS_CM_00111](#_bookmark523)]) of the ServiceSkeleton class has been called). An active subscriber is an adaptive application that has invoked the Subscribe method of the respective Trigger class (see [[SWS_CM_00723](#_bookmark579)]) and has not canceled the subscription by invoking the Unsubscribe method of the respective Trigger class (see [[SWS_CM_00810](#_bookmark580)]) and where the subscription has not yet expired since the TTL contained in the SOME/IP SubscribeEventgroup message (see [[SWS_CM_00205](#_bookmark47)]) has been exceeded.*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00201, RS_SOMEIP_00004, RS_SOMEIP_00005, RS_SOMEIP_-00017, RS_CM_00004)*

Please note that in the Manifest configuration the SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment.eventDeployment is used to configure triggers in the same way as events. The only difference is that in case of a trigger the SomeipEventDeployment will reference the Trigger in the role trigger. Therefore the following specification items described in chapter [7.5.2.1.4](#handling-events-1) are also valid for Triggers since a trigger defines a special kind of an event.

- [[SWS_CM_80022](#_bookmark170)]
- [[SWS_CM_80023](#_bookmark171)]
- [[SWS_CM_80024](#_bookmark172)]

Based on the serviceInterfaceId and eventId the respective trigger is determined. If the serializer is defined as someip serializer the SOME/IP trigger handling applies.

### [SWS_CM_10519] {DRAFT} Content of the SOME/IP serialized trigger message *[*If

SomeipEventDeployment.serializer is set to someip then the entries in the SOME/IP serialized trigger message shall be as follows:

- The Service ID (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00245]) shall be derived from the Manifest where the SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment element defines the serviceInterfaceId.
- The Method ID (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00245]) shall be derived from the Manifest where the SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment element defines the eventDeployment.eventId by adding 0x8000 to the eventDeployment. eventId.
- The Length shall be set to 8
- The Client ID (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00702]) is unused for trigger (according to [PRS_SOMEIP_00702]) and thus shall be set to 0x0000.
- In case of inactive Session Handling, see [[SWS_CM_10240](#_bookmark40)], the Session ID (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00703]) is unused for trigger and thus shall be set to 0x0000 (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00932]) and [PRS_SOMEIP_00925]).

In case of active Session Handling, see [[SWS_CM_10240](#_bookmark40)], the Session ID is used for trigger and thus shall be incremented (with proper wrap around) upon every transmission of an trigger (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00933], [PRS_SOMEIP_00934], [PRS_SOMEIP_00521], and [PRS_SOMEIP_00925]).

The information whether the Session Handling is activated or deactivated for a trigger can be derived from the sessionHandling attribute contained in the ApSomeipTransformationProps that is referenced by the TransformationPropsToServiceInterfaceElementMapping that in turn points to the trigger.

- The Protocol Version (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00052]) shall be set to 0x01.
- The Interface Version (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00053]) shall be derived from the Manifest where the SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment element defines the serviceInterfaceVersion.majorVersion.
- The Message Type (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00055]) shall be set to NOTIFICATION

(0x02).

- The Return Code (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00058] and [PRS_SOMEIP_00191]) is unused for trigger messages and thus (according to [PRS_SOMEIP_00925]) shall be set to E_OK (0x00).

### Signal-Based Static Network binding

The [Signal-Based Static](#_bookmark160) network binding is enabled when a ServiceInstanceToSignalMapping refers to a ProvidedUserDefinedServiceInstance or RequiredUserDefinedServiceInstance of category SIGNALBASED_WITH_HEADER or SIGNALBASED_NO_HEADER.

Please note that there is currently no static *ara::com* API optimization defined, thus it is expected that the adaptive application, which interacts with a ServiceInterface, uses the same steps as in any other service oriented interaction (i.e. calling OfferService(), FindService(), Subscribe(), \...).

The general approach is:

For a ProvidedUserDefinedServiceInstance the connection is established in a UDP / TCP Server role.
For a RequiredUserDefinedServiceInstance the connection is established in a UDP / TCP Client role.

Each connection is defined by the localUdpPortNumber or localTcpPortNumber and one element out of the remotePeers list.

- a message needs to be transmitted for which the udpCollectionTrigger is set to always.
- the udpCollectionBufferTimeout is reached for one of the messages already aggregated in the buffer.
- the buffer size defined by the attribute udpCollectionBufferSizeThreshold is reached.
- adding the event of field notifier to the buffer would lead to a message larger than the maximum possible size (e.g. MTU size). In this case the actual buffer shall be triggered before handling the new event or field notifier.

The DomainParticipantUserDataQos setting provides a discovery protocol that leverages the USER_DATA QoS policy of DDS Domain Participants, assigning a purpose-specific format string to it as described in [7.5.3.1](#service-discovery-via-domain-participant-user_data-qos-policy) below. This approach is fast and nimble, since no additional DDS Entities beyond Domain Participants need to be created to exercise discovery of Service Instances.

The Topic setting provides, as described in section [7.5.3.2](#service-discovery-via-topic) below, a discovery protocol that employs a purpose-specific Topic of a well-defined type to distribute Service Instance announcements in a publish-subscribe, instance-based fashion. This protocol, although more resource-demanding (DDS entities down to a single DataWriter need to be created for Skeletons, same for a DataReader in Proxies), enhances interoperability and enables advanced DDS features such as persistence, routing and durability.

### Handling Method Calls

The RPC over DDS Specification (DDS-RPC) [21] introduces the concept of DDS Services. These Services provide the mechanisms required to define and implement methods that can be invoked remotely by DDS "client" applications using the building blocks of the DDS data-centric publish-subscribe middleware [18]. In this section, we specify how to handle ara::com method calls over DDS by defining the appropriate mapping between ara::com service methods and DDS service methods.

**[SWS_CM_11100] Mapping Methods to DDS Service Methods and Topics** *[*Every ServiceInterface containing one or more ClientServerOperations defined in the role method shall have an associated DDS Service to enable ara::com Service Instances to offer those operations, and to enable client applications to invoke them. The equivalent DDS Service shall provide all of the methods of the corresponding ServiceInterface.

DDS Services shall be constructed according to the Basic Service Mapping Profile of the RPC over DDS specification [21], which assigns two DDS Topics to every DDS Service: a Request Topic and a Reply Topic. Thus, every ServiceInterface containing one or more ClientServerOperations defined in the role method shall trigger the creation of two equivalent DDS Topics.

The equivalent DDS Request Topic shall be configured as follows:

- The Request Topic Name shall be derived from the Manifest according to the following rules:

  If the provided or consumed Service Instance has been advertised with the identifier_type attribute set to SERVICE_INSTANCE_RESOURCE_PARTITION or SER-

VICE_INSTANCE_RESOURCE_INSTANCE_ID, then the topic name shall be set to ara.com://services/\<InterfaceID\>/\<Major\>.\<Minor\>

/\<TopicName\>

- Additionally, if the provided or consumed Service Instance has been advertised with the identifier_type attribute set to SERVICE_INSTANCE_RESOURCE_PARTITION, then samples of this topic shall be sent and received via DataWriters and DataReaders whose respective parent Publisher and Subscriber objects include the following partition in the PARTITION QoS policy: ara.com://services/\<InterfaceID\>/\<InstanceId\>
- Finally, if the provided or consumed Service Instance has been advertised with the identifier_type attribute set to SERVICE_INSTANCE_TOPIC_PREFIX, then the topic name shall be set to ara.com://services/\<InterfaceID\>/\<InstanceID\>/\<TopicName\>

**\<InterfaceID\>** is the value of DdsServiceInterfaceDeployment. serviceInterfaceId

**\<InstanceID\>** is the value of either DdsProvidedServiceInstance. serviceInstanceId or DdsRequiredServiceInstance.requiredServiceInstanceId

**\<Major\> and \<Minor\>** are the values of ServiceInterface.majorVersion and ServiceInterface.minorVersion, respectively

**\<TopicName\>** is the value of DdsServiceInterfaceDeployment. methodRequestTopicName

- The Request Topic Data Type shall be defined as specified in [[SWS_CM_11101](#_bookmark249)], and shall be registered under the equivalent data type's name.

The equivalent DDS Reply Topic shall be configured as follows:

- The Reply Topic Name shall be derived from the Manifest according to the following rules:

  If the provided or consumed Service Instance has been advertised with the identifier_type attribute set to SERVICE_INSTANCE_RESOURCE_PARTITION or SERVICE_INSTANCE_RESOURCE_INSTANCE_ID, then the topic name shall be set to ara.com://services/\<InterfaceID\>/\<Major\>.\<Minor\>

/\<TopicName\>

- Additionally, if the provided or consumed Service Instance has been advertised with the identifier_type attribute set to SERVICE_INSTANCE_RESOURCE_PARTITION, then samples of this topic shall be sent and received via DataWriters and DataReaders whose respective parent Publisher and Subscriber objects include the following partition in the PARTITION QoS policy: ara.com://services/\<InterfaceID\>/\<InstanceId\>
- Finally, if the provided or consumed Service Instance has been advertised with the identifier_type attribute set to SERVICE_INSTANCE_TOPIC_PREFIX, then the topic name shall be set to ara.com://services/\<InterfaceID\>/\<InstanceID\>/\<TopicName\>
- Where:

**\<InterfaceID\>** is the value of DdsServiceInterfaceDeployment. serviceInterfaceId

**\<InstanceID\>** is the value of either DdsProvidedServiceInstance. serviceInstanceId or DdsRequiredServiceInstance.requiredServiceInstanceId

**\<Major\> and \<Minor\>** are the values of ServiceInterface.majorVersion and ServiceInterface.minorVersion, respectively

**\<TopicName\>** is the value of DdsServiceInterfaceDeployment. methodReplyTopicName

- The Reply Topic Data Type shall be defined as specified in [[SWS_CM_11102](#_bookmark250)], and shall be registered under the equivalent data type's name.

As defined in section 7.5.1.1.5 of [21], the \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Result union shall be constructed as follows:

- The union discriminator shall be a 32-bit signed integer.
- The union shall have a case with label dds::RETCODE_OK to represent a successful return:

  The value of RETCODE_OK shall be 0x00, as specified in section 2.3.3 of [18].
  The successful case shall have a single member named result of type

\<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Out (see below).

- The union shall also have a case with label dds::RETCODE_ERROR to represent the ApApplicationError the method may return:

  The value of RETCODE_ERROR shall be 0x01, as specified in section 2.3.3 of [18].
  The error case shall have a single member named error of type ara::core::ErrorCode (see [[SWS_CM_10428](#_bookmark83)]).

The IDL representation of \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Result is the following:

```
1 union \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Result switch(int32) {

2 case dds::RETCODE_OK:

3 \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Out result;

4 case dds::RETCODE_ERROR:

5 ara::core::ErrorCode error;

6 };
```

Lastly, as defined in section 7.5.1.1.5 of [21], the \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\> _Out structure be constructed as follows:

- The structure shall contain as members all the ArgumentDataPrototypes of the ClientServerOperation with direction set to out or inout.
- The members of the structure representing out and inout arguments shall appear in the structure in the same order as they were declared.
- If the method has no out, and no inout arguments, the structure shall contain a single member named dummy of type dds::rpc::UnusedMember (in accordance with section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21]).

The IDL representation of \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Out is the following:

```

2 \<ArgumentDataPrototype[0]\>;

3 \<ArgumentDataPrototype[1]\>;

The resulting Reply Topic data type shall be encoded according to the DDS serialization rules. Unions, such as the \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Result union, shall be serialized as specified in section 7.4.3.5 of [20].*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213, RS_CM_00200)*

**error_code** is a 32-bit signed integer representing the ApApplicationError. errorCode, which is represented on binding level as ara::core::ErrorCode::Value().

ara::core::ErrorCode shall be serialized according to the DDS serialization rules.

**[SWS_CM_11108] Notifying the client of a response to a method call** *[*To notify the client application of a response as a result of a method call, the DDS binding implementation shall invoke either the set_value() operation or the SetError() operation of the ara::core::Promise corresponding to the ara::core::Future that is returned to the caller.

If the discriminator of the \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Result union holding the response for the specific method call in the received DDS Reply Topic sample is dds::RETCODE_OK (i.e., 0 as defined in [18]), the binding implementation shall call the ara::core::Promise's set_value() operation (see [SWS_CORE_00345] and [SWS_CORE_00346]) using the members representing the out and inout arguments in the corresponding \<svcId\>Method_\<methodName\>_Out result (see [[SWS_CM_11102](#_bookmark250)]).

Else, for any other discriminator value, the binding implementation shall call the ara::core::Promise's SetError() operation (see [SWS_CORE_00353]) with the corresponding ara::core::ErrorCode, which is based on the corresponding ApApplicationError (see [[SWS_CM_11102](#_bookmark250)]).

In either case, the associated set operation shall be performed upon the reception of a new Reply Topic sample by the corresponding DDS DataReader (see [[SWS_CM_11104](#_bookmark252)]). The DDS binding shall use the DataReader's take() to process the sample.

**[SWS_CM_11110] Creating a DataReaderListener to process asynchronous requests on the server side** *[*According to [[SWS_CM_11105](#_bookmark253)], a MethodCallProcessingMode of either kEvent or kEventSingleThread requires the instantiation of a DataReaderListener to process asynchronously requests on the server side. The resulting listener shall derive from the standard DataReaderListener class [18], specifying that the data type of the samples to be handled is the Request Topic data type defined in [[SWS_CM_11101](#_bookmark249)].

The DataReaderListener shall implement the following methods according to the specified instructions:

- An on_data_available() method responsible for reading the received requests from the DataReader's cache---using the take() operation---and dispatching them to the appropriate methods for processing. To identify the method of the ServiceSkeleton class that shall process each request, on_data_available() shall use the union discriminator of the \<svcId\> Method_Call and provide the destination method with the specific ArgumentDataPrototypes in the union case.

*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213)*

11The RPC over DDS specification [21] does not mandate a specific mechanism or context to invoke the take() operation on the DataReader that subscribes to method replies.Implementers of this specification may therefore follow different approaches to address this issue.

12For instance, a proxy could provide a ara::core::Map\<dds::SampleIdentity, ara::core::Promise\<T\> \> to hold the ara::core::Promises assigned to every request (identified by their dds::SampleIdentity requestId), and install a DataReaderListener (on the DataReader created in [[SWS_CM_11104](#_bookmark252)]) with an on_data_available() method that could call the setter of the corresponding ara::core::Promise using the relatedRequestId of the received Reply Topic sample to address it. Alternatively, a compliant solution could also call take() in the context of a std::async using a dds::core::Waitset [18] to block until the reception of the expected sample.

**[SWS_CM_11145] DDS Service Request Topic data type definition for Field getter and setter operations** *[*As specified in section 7.5.1.1.6 of [21], the Request Topic data type is a structure composed of a Request Header with meta-data and a Call Structure with data. The IDL definition of the Request Topic data type for the DDS Service handling field getters and setters is the following:

```
1 struct \<svcId\>Field_Request {

2 dds::rpc::RequestHeader header;

3 \<svcId\>Field_Call data;

4 };
```

Where:

**\<svcId\>** is the corresponding serviceInterfaceId.

**dds::rpc::RequestHeader** is the standard Request Header defined in section 1. of [21].

**\<svcId\>Field_Call** is the union that holds the value of the input parameters of the corresponding methods, according to the rules specified in section 7.5.1.1.6 of [21].

dds::rpc::RequestHeader shall be constructed as specified in section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21]. On top of that, the binding implementation shall set the instanceName (a member of the RequestHeader structure that specifies the DDS service instance name) to a string representation of the serviceInstanceId of the service instance that provides the fields (which have getters or setters).

\<svcId\>Field_Call shall be constructed as specified in section 7.5.1.1.6 of [21].

- The name of the union shall be \<svcId\>Field_Call.
- The union discriminator shall be a 32-bit signed integer.
- The union shall have a default case of type dds::rpc::UnknownOperation (defined in section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21]) for unsupported and unknown operations.

- The union shall have a case label for each hasGetter and hasSetter attribute equal to true in the Fields defined in the ServiceInterface with the role field, where:

  The integer value of the case label shall be a 32-bit hash of the field getter or setter name. That is, \"Get\<fieldName\>\" and \"Set\<fieldName\>\"; where \<fieldName\> is the shortName of the Field. The binding implementation shall compute the hash as specified in section 1. of [21]. Representations of the service interface in OMG IDL [23] shall define 32-bit signed integer constants (i.e., const int32 \<svcId\> Field_Get\<fieldName\>_Hash or const int32 \<svcId\>Field_Set\<fieldName\>_Hash) to simplify the representation of the union cases (see below).

- The member name for the case label shall be get\<FieldName\> for getter methods and set\<FieldName\> for setter methods.
- The type for each case level shall be \<svcId\>Field_Get\<fieldName\>_In for getter methods, and \<svcId\>Field_Set\<fieldName\>_In for setter methods, which shall be constructed as specified in section 7.5.1.1.4 of [21] (see below).

The IDL definition of the \<svcId\>Field_Call union is the following:

```
1 union \<svcId\>Field_Call switch(int32) {

2 default:

3 dds::rpc::UnknownOperation unknownOp;

4 case \<svcId\>Field_Get\<Field0Name\>_Hash:

According to 7.5.1.1.4 of [21], \<svcId\>Field_Set\<FieldName\>_In structures shall contain as member, the corresponding StdCppImplementationDataType representing the value of Field to be set. Conversely, \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_In shall contain a single member named dummy of type dds::rpc::UnusedMember (see section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21]) to indicate that the method has no input parameters.

The resulting Request Topic data type shall be encoded according to the DDS serialization rules. Unions, such as the \<svcId\>Field_Call union, shall be serialized as specified in section 7.4.3.5 of [20].*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213)*

**[SWS_CM_11146] DDS Service Reply Topic data type definition for Field getter and setter operations** *[*As specified in section 7.5.1.1.7 of [21], the Reply Topic data type is a structure composed of a Reply Header with meta-data and a Return Structure with data. The IDL definition of the Reply Topic data type for the DDS Service handling field getters and setters is the following:

```
1 struct \<svcId\>Field_Reply {

2 dds::rpc::ReplyHeader header;

3 \<svcId\>Field_Return data;

4 };
```

Where:

**\<svcId\>** is the corresponding serviceInterfaceId.

**dds::rpc::ReplyHeader** is the standard Reply Header defined in section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21].

**\<svcId\>Field_Return** is the union that holds the return values of the corresponding response, according to the rules specified in section 7.5.1.1.7 of [21].

dds::rpc::ReplyHeader shall be constructed as specified in section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21].

\<svcId\>Field_Return shall be constructed as specified in section 7.5.1.1.7 of [21]:

- The name of the union shall be \<svcId\>Field_Return.
- The union discriminator shall be a 32-bit signed integer.
- The union shall have a default case of type dds::rpc::UnknownOperation

(defined in section 7.5.1.1.1 of [21]) for unsupported and unknown operations.

- The union shall have a case label for each hasGetter and hasSetter attribute equal to true in the Fields defined in the ServiceInterface with the role field, where:

  The integer value of the case label shall be a 32-bit hash of the field getter or setter name. That is, \"Get\<FieldName\>\" and \"Set\<FieldName\>\"; where \<FieldName\> is the shortName of the Field. The binding implementation shall compute the hash as specified in section 7.5.1.1.2 of [21].

- The member name of the case label shall be get\<FieldName\> for getter methods and set\<FieldName\> for setter methods.
- The type for each case label shall be \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Result for getter methods and \<svcId\>Field_Set\<FieldName\>_Result for setter methods, which shall be constructed as specified in section 4. of [21] (see below).

The IDL definition of \<svcId\>Field_Return is the following:

```
1 union \<svcId\>Field_Return switch(int32) {

2 default:

17 };
```

According with [[SWS_CM_00112](#_bookmark588)] and [[SWS_CM_00113](#_bookmark591)], both getters and setters have the same output parameter. Therefore, in accordance with section 5. of [21], both the \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Result and \<svcId\> Field_Set\<FieldName\>_Result unions shall be constructed as follows:

   The union discriminator shall be a 32-bit signed integer.
   The union shall have a case with label dds::RETCODE_OK to represent a successful return:

   The value of RETCODE_OK shall be 0, as specified in section 2.3.3 of [18].
   The successful case shall have a single member named result_ of type

\<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Out to hold the value to be returned to the getter, or type \<svcId\>Field_Set\<FieldName\>_Out to hold the value to be returned to the setter (see below).

The IDL representation of \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Result is the following:

```
1 union \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Result switch(int32) {

2 case dds::RETCODE_OK:

3 \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Out result_;

4 };
```

Likewise, the IDL representation of \<svcId\>Field_Set\<FieldName\>_Result is the following:

```

2 case dds::RETCODE_OK:

```

Both types \<svcId\>Field_Get\<FieldName\>_Out and its counterpart \<svcId\> Field_Set\<FieldName\>_Out shall map to a structure with a single member named return_ of the StdCppImplementationDataType representing the value of the corresponding Field.

The resulting Reply Topic data type shall be encoded according to the DDS serialization rules. Unions, such as the \<svcId\>Field_Return union, shall be serialized as specified in section 7.4.3.5 of [20].*â™©(RS_CM_00204, RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213)*

**[SWS_CM_11154] Creating a DataReaderListener to process asynchronous requests for field getters and setters on the server side** *[*According to [[SWS_CM_11149](#_bookmark270)], a MethodCallProcessingMode of either kEvent or kEventSingleThread requires the instantiation of a DataReaderListener to process asynchronously requests on the server side. The resulting listener shall derive from the standard DataReaderListener class [18], specifying that the type of the samples to be handled is the Request Topic data type defined in [[SWS_CM_11145](#_bookmark266)].

The DataReaderListener shall implement the following method according to the specified instructions:

- An on_data_available() method responsible for reading the received requests from the DataReader's cache---using the take() operation---and dispatching it to the corresponding registered SetHandler or---if it applies--GetHandler (see [[SWS_CM_00114](#_bookmark543)] and [[SWS_CM_00116](#_bookmark546)]). To identify the field of the ServiceSkeleton class, the operation (i.e., Set() or Get()), and therefore the corresponding handler; on_data_available() shall use the union discriminator of the \<svcId\>Field_Call union (see [[SWS_CM_11145](#_bookmark266)]). In the case of a Set() operation, the method shall provide the corresponding SetHandler with the only member of the received \<svcId\>Field_\<FieldName\>_In structure, which contains the new value to be set.

- To initialize the ReplyHeader object,

  relatedRequestId shall be set to the value of the header.requestId attribute of the request that triggered the method call (see [[SWS_CM_11151](#_bookmark272)]).

Hence, End-to-end communication protection as described in sections [7.7.1](#end-to-end-communication-protection-for-events) and [7.7.2](#end-to-end-communication-protection-for-methods) doesn't apply, because API calls can't be checksummed or payloaded the same way serialized messages are.

By no means does this imply that DDS is exempt from E2E protection assurances, they are simply provided by the DDS middleware. Please find below the different kinds of faults defined in [4] (derived from ISO-26262-6:2011, annex D.2.4) and their corresponding DDS/RTPS protection mechanism:

- Repetition, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, information from a sender received by only a subset of receivers, and blocking access to a communication channel: submessage 64-bit sequence number, as defined in [19] section 8.3.5.4 \"SequenceNumber\", and additional SequenceNumber-typed fields in section 8.3.7 \"RTPS Submessages\"

- Delay of information and blocking access to a communication channel: LATENCY_BUDGET Quality of Service policy, as defined in [18] section 2.2.3.8 \"LATENCY_BUDGET\"
- Masquerade or incorrect addressing of information: DDS Security authentication plugin, as defined in [25] section 8.3 \"Authentication Plugin\"
- Corruption of information, asymmetric information sent from a sender to multiple receivers: rtpsMessageChecksum under HeaderExtension submessage ([RTPS 2.5 or higher]). In absence of this feature, [25] also provides message integrity verification built into its message authentication protocol
- Translation of these fault conditions into ara::com::e2e::ProfileCheckStatus values depends on the specific capacities of the DDS implementation to report per-sample the status of the aforementioned protection measures (sequence numbers, latency budget, message authentications, checksums)

  1. ## Security

In the following chapter the behavior according to the meta-model of access control and secure communication shall be described.

### IAM

Access control for Communication Management allows to restrict the instances and elements of services that a local application or a *remote subject* (e.g., a remote ECU) may request to access. Having access control in place reduces the potential damage that a compromised application (in case of local IAM) or a compromised ECU (in case of remote IAM) can cause.

Figure [7.19](#_bookmark288) demonstrates an example scenario where local IAM and remote IAM can take place. Upon a method call from a service, the client's request will be checked by the local IAM to ensure that the application is issuing a legitimate request based on its configured access rights. After successful authorization, the request will be forwarded to the machine where the service is running. When the request arrives at the recipient machine, the remote IAM takes place and a check will be performed to verify if such a request coming from the given sender ECU was envisioned.

**Figure 7.19:** **Local and Remote Identity and Access Management**

The following assumptions have to be held true to realize access control:

1. Communication between two applications has to be realized by using ara::com interfaces Communication Management to enable access control.
2. Process separation as defined in SWS IdentityAndAccessManagement [26].

All access permissions for Communication Management are modeled using ComGrant model elements. A ComGrant can be used to model access permissions that either apply to a Machine-local Process or to a remote subject, i.e., either a local Process or a remote entity can be the *subject* of the access control policy: If a ComGrant references an AbstractIamRemoteSubject in the role remoteSubject, then the subjects of the ComGrant are all remote entities that can be identified using the information specified in the referenced AbstractIamRemoteSubject. If a ComGrant does not reference any remoteSubject, then the subjects of the ComGrant are all Processes referenced in the role process by ServiceInstanceToPortPrototypeMappings which reference an AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance in the role serviceInstance that is referenced by the ComGrant in the role serviceInstance.

Local access control and remote access control may be enforced independently from each other.

### Configuration of Access Control

While Identity and Access Management (IAM) serves as an umbrella for access control on the Adaptive Platform, the enforcement of access control is implemented in different functional clusters such as CM. If no IAM Functional Cluster is instantiated on a Machine, then no enforcement of access control by CM is expected.

**[SWS_CM_10492]**{DRAFT} **IAM Module Instantiation** *[*If no IamModuleInstantiation is defined on the Machine, CM shall perform no access control, i.e., no access to any service shall be restricted because of missing ComGrants.*â™©(RS_IAM_00002)*

Depending on the architecture and the security model, all local Processes might be trusted, thus not requiring local access control. Furthermore, it is possible that all remote ECUs are trusted, e.g., because access control is already performed locally. For these cases, there are two configuration options to enable remote access control and local access control independently.

**[SWS_CM_10493]**{DRAFT} **Local Access Control Activation** *[*If IamModuleInstantiation.localComAccessControlEnabled is defined and is set to false, CM shall perform no local access control, i.e., no access to any service from a local Process shall be restricted because of missing ComGrants. If IamModuleInstantiation is defined on the Machine and IamModuleInstantiation.localComAccessControlEnabled is not defined or is set to true, CM shall perform local access control.*â™©(RS_IAM_00002)*

**[SWS_CM_10494]**{DRAFT} **Remote Access Control Activation** *[*If IamModuleInstantiation.remoteAccessControlEnabled is defined and is set to false, CM shall perform no remote access control, i.e., no access to any service from a remote subject shall be restricted because of missing ComGrants. If IamModuleInstantiation is defined on the Machine and IamModuleInstantiation.remoteAccessControlEnabled is not defined or is set to true, CM shall perform remote access control.*â™©(RS_IAM_00002)*

**[SWS_CM_90001]**{DRAFT} **Restrictions on executing methods** *[*The invocation of a method by an application shall be executed depending on the existence of ComMethodGrant, ComFieldGrant without a reference remoteSubject and with the role attribute of ComFieldGrant set to FieldAccessEnum.getter or FieldAccessEnum.setter.

### Remote Access Control

In order to enforce access control on remote entities, the requesting entity first has to be authenticated, i.e., the identity of the *remote subject* has to be established. Then, it has to be decided whether the access is allowed according to the modeled grants.

There are currently three ways to authenticate a remote subject:

- **TLS:** If the remote subject is connected via (D)TLS secure communication, properties of this TLS connection and the used certificates can be used for authenticating the remote subject.
- **IPsec:** If IPsec is used to establish secure communication, IP related information specified for IPsec configuration can be used for authenticating the remote subject.
- **IP:** If IP based communication is used and the authenticity of communication partners can be guaranteed by, e.g., the operational environment, IP related information can be used for authenticating the remote subject.

Please note that while SecOC can also provide authenticity of a communication partner, it is not used in this section, because the existing association between SecOC keys and DataIDs already provides a fine grained access control mechanism directly on the level of secure communication and thus additionally applying IAM would not yield any benefit.

**[SWS_CM_10495]**{DRAFT} **TLS-based Authentication** *[*Communication Management shall associate remote subjects communicating via an established (D)TLS connection to a TlsIamRemoteSubject according to [TPS_MANI_03240].*â™©(RS_CM_00803)*

**[SWS_CM_10496]**{DRAFT} **IP and IPsec-based Authentication** *[*Communication Management shall associate remote subjects communicating via IP to an IPSecIamRemoteSubject or an IpIamRemoteSubject according to [TPS_MANI_03242] and [TPS_MANI_03244].*â™©(RS_CM_00803)*

Please note that IPsec is usually handled by the OS and may therefore be transparent to Communication Management. Therefore, authentication of IPsec secured connections relies on tuples of IP addresses, protocols, and ports only.

**[SWS_CM_10497]**{DRAFT} **Authentication Failure** *[*If IamModuleInstantiation. remoteAccessControlEnabled is set to true and a remote subject cannot be authenticated, Communication Management shall silently drop all messages from this remote subject.*â™©(RS_CM_00803)*

### Secure Communication

Communication in Adaptive Platform can be transported via TCP and UDP. Therefore different security mechanisms have to be available to secure the communication. Thefollowing security protocols are currently supported:

- TLS 1.2 (see [RFC5246])
- DTLS 1.2 (see [RFC6347])
- SecOC
- IPSec
- DDS Security
- MACsec

The configuration of SecOc and TLS security protocols has a dependency on the network binding:

- For SOME/IP network binding AUTOSAR allows the configuration of secure communication for a ServiceInterface by configuring either TlsSecureComProps meta-class or SecOcSecureComProps meta-class . Both are specialization of SecureComProps class that is referenced by ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping. In the case of SecOc additionally ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfig needs to be defined and it determines the configuration settings for the individual ServiceInterface elements. When TlsSecureComProps is configured, all the service interface elements are secured and ServiceInterfaceElementSecureComConfig is not used.

- For Signal based network binding, only SecOc configuration is possible, and the configuration is determined by SecureCommunicationAuthenticationProps of a SecuredIPdu referenced by the PduTriggering. SecureComProps is not used in the context of signal-based network binding.
- For DDS Network binding, DDS Transport Security over TCP (TLS), DDS Transport Security over UDP (DTLS) and DDS Security [25] (as transport-independent security) are valid, independent and mutually exclusive choices for securing underlying DDS communications.

The configuration of Ipsec (IPSecConfig) in aggregated by a NetworkEndpoint therefore it is independent of the network binding.

SOME/IP supports one-to-many (unicast) and many-to-many (multicast) communication paradigms. These paradigms may switch at runtime for events (see multicastThreshold).

It is therefore important to be aware of the limitations of the secure channel approach:

- ### Confidentiality of events

If events are transported using UDP and may be sent using multicast, they cannot be guaranteed confidential due to the fact that only SecOC can be used to secure multicast communication and SecOC does not offer confidentiality. This restriction does not apply to DDS Security.

1. ### Creation and use of secure channels

   1. **SOME/IP and DDS network binding**

**[SWS_CM_90101]**{DRAFT} **Secure UDP and TCP channel creation for TLS, DTLS and SecOC** *[*The Communication Management software shall create secure UDP channels according to the input for all SecureComProps referenced by ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping in the role secureComPropsForUdp. The Communication Management software shall create secure TCP channels according to the input for all SecureComProps referenced by ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping in the role secureComPropsForTcp. Secure channels may be shared by multiple AdaptivePlatformServiceInstances by multiplexing the communication, i.e. by referencing the same SecureComProps in the same role.*â™©(RS_CM_00801)*

**[SWS_CM_90102]**{DRAFT} **Using secure TLS, DTLS and SecOC channels** *[*All communication triggered by a Skeleton or Proxy shall be sent via the respective secure channel according to the configuration input. In the configuration the appropriate secure channel is identified by examining the references to SecureComProps of ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping for the AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance that is mapped to an EthernetCommunicationConnector of a Machine by this ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping.*â™©(RS_CM_00801, RS_CM_00803)*

The actual secure channel to be created is determined by the concrete sub-class of the SecureComProps base-class.

**[SWS_CM_90201]**{DRAFT} **Secure TLS and DTLS channel creation in the DDS Network Binding** *[*Secure channels shall be created as specified in [[SWS_CM_90101](#_bookmark299)].*â™©(RS_CM_00801)*

### Raw data streaming

**[SWS_CM_90211] Secure UDP and TCP channel creation for TLS and DTLS** *[*The Communication Management software shall create secure UDP and TCP channels according to the input for all TlsSecureComProps as part of the EthernetRawDataStreamMapping.*â™©(RS_CM_00801)*

**[SWS_CM_90212] Using secure TLS, DTLS channels** *[*All communication triggered by a RawDataStream shall be sent via the respective secure channel according to the input. The appropriate secure channel is defined in the TlsSecureComProps as part of the EthernetRawDataStreamMapping that is mapped to an EthernetCommunicationConnector.*â™©(RS_CM_00801, RS_CM_00803)*

### (D)TLS

A (D)TLS secure channel may provide authenticity, integrity and confidentiality which may be used on combination with SOME/IP and DDS network binding as well as with raw data streaming.

The TLS and DTLS implementation should support the following cipher suites:

- TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256 for authentic communication (see [RFC5487])
- TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 for confidential communication (see [RFC5487])

  1. ### SOME/IP Network binding

**[SWS_CM_90103]**{DRAFT} **TLS secure channel for ServiceInterface content using reliable transport** *[*A TLS secure channel shall be created and used if a TlsSecureComProps instance is referenced in the role secureComPropsForTcp by a ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping. All content of the ServiceInterface that is referenced by the AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance that in turn is referenced by the ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping that is configured for transmission over "tcp" in the ServiceInterfaceDeployment is selected for transmission over the TLS secured channel.*â™©(RS_CM_00801)*

**[SWS_CM_90104]**{DRAFT} **DTLS secure channel for ServiceInterface content using unreliable transport** *[*A DTLS secure channel shall be created and used if a TlsSecureComProps instance is referenced in the role secureComPropsForUdp by a ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping. All content of the ServiceInterface that is referenced by the AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance that in turn is referenced by the ServiceInstanceToMachineMapping that is configured for transmission over "udp" in the ServiceInterfaceDeployment is selected for transmission over the TLS secured channel.*â™©(RS_CM_00801)*

**[SWS_CM_90121]**{DRAFT} **TLS server role of a Skeleton** *[*The TLS secure channel shall be associated with the respective [Skeleton](#_bookmark5) and the implementation shall act as a TLS server, if the AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance referenced in

- [[SWS_CM_90103](#_bookmark305)]
- [[SWS_CM_90104](#_bookmark306)]

is a ProvidedApServiceInstance.*â™©(RS_CM_00801)*

According to the constraints [constr_3485] and [constr_3486] a [Proxy](#_bookmark6) and [Skeleton](#_bookmark5) cannot be bound to the identical local endpoint (IP address and port). Hence, a local endpoint can either act as a TLS client or as a TLS server exclusively. However, if multiple [Proxys](#_bookmark6) are bound to the same endpoint, their common channel shall be shared in the middleware. Likewise, if multiple [Skeletons](#_bookmark5) are bound to the same endpoint, their common channel shall be shared in the middleware.

**[SWS_CM_90119]**{DRAFT} **Behavior of a creating ServiceProxy over TLS or DTLS** *[*The instantiation according to [[SWS_CM_00131](#_bookmark557)] shall trigger the asynchronous handshake.*â™©(RS_CM_00804)*

**[SWS_CM_90111]**{DRAFT} **Behavior of a ServiceProxy over TLS before successful completion of the handshake** *[*The communication channel is ready as soon as the TLS handshake is completed.

Therefore, the future returned by the following methods shall only be satisfied after the handshake has finished and once the communication was successful:

- the function call operator (operator()) of the respective Method class (see [[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)])
- the Set() method of the respective Field class (see [[SWS_CM_00113](#_bookmark591)])
- the Get() method of the respective Field class (see [[SWS_CM_00112](#_bookmark588)])

If the handshake fails, the error code ComErrc::kPeerIsUnreachable shall be returned in the Future of the respective methods (operator(), Set(), Get()). The error shall be logged.*â™©(RS_CM_00804)*

**[SWS_CM_90112]**{DRAFT} **Behavior of a ServiceProxy over DTLS before successful completion of the handshake** *[*The communication channel is ready as soon as the DTLS handshake is completed. Before completion the middleware shall drop all requests as if the remote peer is unreachable.*â™©(RS_CM_00804)*

The rationale for choosing different behavior in [[SWS_CM_90111](#_bookmark307)] and [[SWS_CM_90112](#_bookmark308)] is to reflect the nature of the underlying transport. E.g. plain UDP would also silently discard packets that cannot be sent, where TCP would report an error.

**[SWS_CM_90113]**{DRAFT} **Behavior of a ServiceSkeleton over TLS before successful completion of the handshake** *[*The communication channel is ready as soon as the TLS handshake is completed. Therefore, [[SWS_CM_10287](#_bookmark56)] and [[SWS_CM_10319](#_bookmark97)] shall be extended to checking whether the TLS handshake did successfully finish.

Therefore, as if the proxy was not connected, the invocation of the following methods shall not result in sending any data:

- the Send() method of the respective Event class (see [[SWS_CM_00162](#sws_cm_00162-send-event-where-application-is-responsible-for-the-data)])
- the Send() method of the respective Trigger class (see [[SWS_CM_00721](#_bookmark535)])

### DDS Network Binding (secure transports)

DDS is built upon the Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (RTPS) wire protocol, which allows different implementations of the standard to interoperate at the wire level. The DDSRTPS specification [19] defines the wire protocol using a Model Driven Architecture; i.e., in terms of a Platform-Independent Model (PIM), which can be mapped to Platform Specific Models (PSM) targeting different transport protocols. In particular, [19] defines a UDP PSM, and different DDS vendors have implemented TCP PSMs[15](#_bookmark313), and Shared Memory PSMs for Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

For consistency with the secure channel modeling and secure communication mechanisms specified in [7.6.2.2.1](#someip-network-binding-1), this section defines support for communication over the following security protocols:

- DTLS, for secure communication over UDP.
- TLS, for secure communication over TCP.
- IPSec, for secure communication over IP.

### Raw Data Streaming

Raw Data Stream communication can be transported via TCP and UDP. Therefore different security mechanism have to be available to secure the stream communication. The following security protocols are currently supported:

- TLS
- DTLS
- IPSec

### SecOC

The Secure Onboard Communication (SecOC) feature is embedded into the Adaptive Communication Management. The behavioral aspects of the SecOC protocol are specified in the *PRS_SecOcProtocolSpecification*.

One major goal is to achieve interoperability with the AUTOSAR Classic Platform *SecOC* functionality. This is especially applicable to the usage of *UDP multicast* messages (where SecOC is currently the only protocol supported) and secured signalbased communication with AUTOSAR Classic Platform through the signal-based network binding.

The SecOC secure channel may provide authenticity and integrity.

**Figure 7.20: SecOC embedded in the Adaptive Communication Management**

In order to achieve interoperability with the AUTOSAR Classic Platform the SecOC should be applied identically also in Adaptive Communication Management. The authentication information comprises of an Authenticator (e.g. Message Authentication Code) and optionally a Freshness Value.

The SOME/IP Message Header as shown in figure [7.21](#_bookmark317) divided into two parts: Part I containing the Message ID and the Length and Part II containing Request ID, Protocol Version, Interface Version, Message Type and Return Code(SOME/IP Protocol Specification [5]).

bit offset



**Figure 7.21:** **SOME/IP header structure**

In figure [7.23](#_bookmark319) the handling of the SOME/IP payload, the SecOC part, and the SOME/IP Message Header are illustrated. This setup is defined by the AUTOSAR Classic platform. In order to achieve interoperability the Communication Management shall implement an identical behavior. It is essential that the Part I of the SOME/IP Message header is NOT covered by the SecOC calculation.

To keep the interoperability with the AUTOSAR Classic Platform and provide the optional Freshness Value Management functionality the Adaptive Communication Management will rely on a pluggable Freshness Value Management Library.

For E2E-protected Events, in case serialized data for one or more samples are received, then for each sample, the following steps are to be done:

**[SWS_CM_90408]**{DRAFT} *[*For the given E2E-protected sample, GetNewSamples shall process the non-E2E protected header (if any) of the sample's serialized data.*â™© (RS_CM_00224, RS_E2E_08540)*

**[SWS_CM_90410]**{DRAFT} *[*For the given E2E-protected sample, E2E_check shall be invoked on the protected serialized data (passed as argument serializedData to E2E_check) according to [RS_E2E_08540] and [PRS_E2E_00323].*â™©(RS_E2E_08540)*

**[SWS_CM_90454]**{DRAFT} *[*For the given E2E-protected sample, the End2EndEventProtectionProps.dataId shall be passed as argument dataID to E2E_check.*â™©(RS_E2E_08540)*

**[SWS_CM_90411]**{DRAFT} *[*In return, for the given E2E-protected sample, E2E_check shall provide a Result (e2eResult according to [PRS_E2E_00322] of [4]) containing the elements SMState (e2eState according to [PRS_E2E_00322] of [4]) and ProfileCheckStatus (e2eStatus according to [PRS_E2E_00322] of [4]).*â™© (RS_E2E_08540, RS_E2E_08534)*

### Case 2 there are no serialized samples

For E2E-protected Events, in case no serialized data are received, the steps are simpler and E2E protection works as timeout detection.

**[SWS_CM_90415]**{DRAFT} *[*E2E_check shall be invoked on a null sample (i.e., a null pointer shall be passed as argument serializedData to E2E_check) according to [RS_E2E_08540] and [PRS_E2E_00323].*â™©(RS_E2E_08540)*

### Subscriber Callable f

The user provided Callable f is invoked for each received sample. The Callable f is called with the SamplePtr of the corresponding sample as parameter. The SamplePtr contains the deserialized sample including the ProfileCheckStatus.

### Subscriber Access to E2E information

**[SWS_CM_90457]**{DRAFT} *[*Each SamplePtr shall provide a GetProfileCheckStatus method to access the ProfileCheckStatus of each sample (see [[SWS_CM_90420](#_bookmark479)]).*â™©(RS_CM_00224, RS_E2E_08540)*

### End-to-end communication protection for Methods

This section specifies the integration of E2E communication protection in ara::com for the processing of Methodss. This includes E2E communication protection for a Method's request as well as E2E communication protection for any kind of Method's response (i.e., normal or error response).

**[SWS_CM_10460]**{DRAFT} *[*An E2E-protected Method shall have its options configured in End2EndMethodProtectionProps and E2EProfileConfiguration.*â™© (RS_CM_00400, RS_E2E_08540)*

**[SWS_CM_90485]**{DRAFT} *[*The E2E functions mentioned in this section using the name E2E_protect and E2E_check shall meet the requirements on E2E protection as defined in [7] and comply with the E2E protection protocol specification of [4] (especially [PRS_E2E_00828]).*â™©(RS_CM_00400, RS_E2E_08541, RS_CM_00223)*

For each specific Method class ([[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)]) belonging to a specific ServiceProxy class and for each provided method (see [[SWS_CM_00191](#_bookmark537)]) belonging to a specific ServiceSkeleton class the E2E dataID based on, e.g., a combination of Service ID, Service Instance ID and Method ID is available.

Within the scope of this section a failed E2E check is an invocation of E2E_check returning an e2eStatus of either REPEATED, WRONGSEQUENCE, NOTAVAILABLE, or NONEWDATA. A successful E2E check is an invocation of E2E_check returning an e2eStatus different from REPEATED, WRONGSEQUENCE, NOTAVAILABLE, and NONEWDATA.

### Limitations

The specified E2E communication protection for methods is limited.

- The processing mode kEvent (concurrent threads) is not supported for E2E protected methods.
- EndToEndTransformationComSpecProps are not supported.

General limitations regarding E2E protection and the detectable failure modes are described in [4].

The values of the following E2E parameters are defined as fixed by the standard and shall not be changed. See [PRS_E2E_00324] of [4]:

- counterOffset
- crcOffset
- dataIdNibbleOffset

The value of following E2E parameters shall be set to the default values specified by [PRS_E2E_00324] of [4]:

- offset

The value of dataIdMode for Methods and the getters and setters of Fields shall be set according to the dataIdMode of the E2EProfileConfiguration which is referenced (in role e2eProfileConfiguration) by the AdaptivePlatformServiceInstance.e2eMethodProtectionProps which reference (in role method) the ServiceMethodDeployment of the particular Method or the Field getter/setter.

### E2E protection of the service method request (Client)

**[SWS_CM_10462]**{DRAFT} *[*For E2E-protected Methods, E2E protection of the request message shall be performed within the context of the operator() of the Method class (see [[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)]) of the respective service method.*â™©(RS_CM_00400, RS_E2E_08541)*

Figure [7.28](#_bookmark357) shows an overview of the interaction of components involved during the E2E protection of the Method request at the client side.

### E2E checking of the payload

For E2E-protected Method requests, in case serialized data are available the following steps are to be done:

**[SWS_CM_90459]**{DRAFT} *[*For the given E2E-protected Method request, the nonE2E-protected header (if any) of the Method request's serialized data shall be processed.*â™©(RS_CM_00400, RS_E2E_08541)*

### Deserializing the payload

In case the call to E2E_check (according to [[SWS_CM_90459](#_bookmark367)]) indicated a successful E2E check of the request message further processing of the request message shall take place.

**[SWS_CM_90463]**{DRAFT} *[*For the given E2E-protected Method request, the resulting serialized data shall be deserialized according to the rules of the respective network binding (e.g., according to [[SWS_CM_10304](#_bookmark76)] in case of SOME/IP network binding), resulting in the deserialized in and inout arguments to the Method call.*â™©(RS_CM_00400, RS_E2E_08541)*

### E2E error notification

In case the call to E2E_check (according to [[SWS_CM_90459](#_bookmark367)]) indicated a failed E2E check of the request message, the server application can get notified via an E2E error handler.

The registration of an application's E2E error handler is static (before runtime). A dynamic registration/de-registration of an application's E2E error handler (like a publisher/subscriber pattern) is neither necessary nor possible.

**[SWS_CM_10470]**{DRAFT} **E2E Error Handler Existence** *[*The ServiceSkeleton shall provide a virtual E2EErrorHandler method with arguments for errorCode, dataID, and messageCounter. This E2EErrorHandler function shall have an empty implementation which may be overridden by the actual ServiceSkeleton implementation. The E2EErrorHandler implementation is not required to be reentrant.

```

```

*â™©(RS_CM_00401, RS_CM_00402)*

**Note Faulty DataID:** If the E2E error is a CRC error then some parts of the received message are faulty. If this part is the DataID then the E2E error handler is called with a faulty DataID. Consequently, in case of CRC error the server application can not rely on the DataID received by its error handler.

**[SWS_CM_90464]**{DRAFT} **E2E Error Handler Invocation** *[*E2EErrorHandler shall be invoked from within a separate thread by the Communication Management software in case E2E_check reports an E2E error.*â™©(RS_CM_00401, RS_CM_00402)*

### E2E error notification

In case the call to E2E_check (according to [[SWS_CM_90473](#_bookmark382)]) indicated a failed E2E check of the response message, the client application shall get notified in the following way:

**[SWS_CM_90477]**{DRAFT} **E2E Error Return Code** *[*For the given E2E-protected Method response in case of failed E2E check an ara::core::ErrorCode of error domain ara::com::e2e::E2EErrorDomain with value set to ProfileCheckStatus obtained in [[SWS_CM_90478](#_bookmark383)] shall be constructed according to [[SWS_CM_90421](#_bookmark508)].

The handling of normal and application error responses (according to [[SWS_CM_90476](#_bookmark386)]) combined with the handlling of E2E error responses (according to [[SWS_CM_10473](#_bookmark387)]) and the explicit notification of E2E errors detected in the response message (according to [[SWS_CM_90477](#_bookmark389)]) will yield an ara::core::Result containing either

- the correct output of the server operation in case of absence of any error
- an ara::core::ErrorCode of the error domain ApApplicationError.errorDomain with the value set to ApApplicationError.errorCode of the raised ApApplicationError in case the ClientServerOperation raised one of its configured possible ClientServerOperation.possibleApErrors and no E2E error was detected in the request message and the response message
- an ara::core::ErrorCode of error domain ara::com::e2e::E2EErrorDomain and the value set to the ProfileCheckStatus of the Result of the E2E_check call at the server side in case an E2E error was detected in the request message at the server side and no E2E error was detected in the response message at the client side
- an ara::core::ErrorCode of error domain ara::com::e2e::E2EErrorDomain and the value set to the ProfileCheckStatus of the Result of the E2E_check call at the client side in case an E2E error was detected in the response message at the client side

### Timeout supervision

ara::com does not support any timeout supervision for method calls. A lost response message could block some ara::core::Future methods like wait() forever. In case of E2E such a timeout supervision is desired, wherefore the adaptive application is strongly recommended to implement timeout supervision, e.g., by using the ReportCheckpoint() method of the ara::phm::SupervisedEntity or the wait_for(), wait_until(), or the is_ready() methods of the ara::core::Future.

### End-to-end communication protection for Fields

This section specifies E2E protection for fields. For details of fields see [5]. A field is a data object that can be accessed by a getter and/or setter method. In addition update notifications may be provided to subscribers, whenever the value of the field gets updated. The principle of fields is already specified. This section specifies the E2E protection for fields. The E2E protection for methods Get and Set follows the E2E protection for Methods (chapter [7.7.2](#end-to-end-communication-protection-for-methods)). The specifications [[SWS_CM_10460](#_bookmark353)] and [[SWS_CM_90485](#_bookmark354)] define the parameters for E2E protection of the methods Get() and Set(). The limitations of chapter [7.7.2.1](#limitations-3) are applicable.

The E2E protection for Update follows the E2E protection for events (chapter [7.7.1](#end-to-end-communication-protection-for-events)). The specifications [[SWS_CM_90402](#_bookmark339)] and [[SWS_CM_90433](#_bookmark340)] define the parameters for E2E protection of the update event. The limitations of chapter [7.7.1.1](#limitations-2) are applicable.

E2E results OK and OK_SOME_LOST are successful results. E2E results ERROR, REPEATED, WRONGSEQUENCE, NOTAVAILABLE and NONEWDATA are considered error results.

There are E2E profiles 4m, 7m, 8m or 44m for the protection of methods (Get, Set). Also the other E2E profiles can be used for the protection of methods. But in this case some parameters of SOME/IP are not protected.

### Send a GET message

The client application calls the Get() function at ara::com without arguments. A future for this method call is created by ara::com. Data of method Get() are serialized.

The E2E serialization follows the specification of [[SWS_CM_90458](#_bookmark359)] with the following exception: The result is a list without parameters because a Get() method has no IN or INOUT parameters.

The parameters dataID, sourceID, messageType and messageResult for E2E_XXmProtect method are passed as described in chapter [7.7.2.2.2](#e2e-protection-of-the-payload).

After E2E protection the non E2E protected part is added to the message as described in [[SWS_CM_10464](#_bookmark361)].

Figure [7.33](#_bookmark393) shows the message flow of sending a Get() method. The figure does not list all details of E2E protection, e.g. functions of CRC library are omitted in this figure.

![](./media/image85.png)![](./media/image86.png)

**Figure 7.33:** **Send a GET Message**

### Receive a GET message

The message is received by the Publisher application. The Publisher application is a server application.

The E2E check of the received message follows the specification of chapter [7.7.2.3](#e2e-checking-the-service-method-request-server).

The type of the message to be sent back to the client is RESPONSE or ERROR. That depends on the result of the E2E check. If the E2E check fails, then the Return Code of the ERROR message is initialized with an E2E error code (See [PRS_SOMEIP_00191]).

Figure [7.34](#_bookmark395) shows the reception of a GET message. The E2E protected part of the serialized header is checked for E2E errors. If the incoming message was received with an E2E error, then the Publisher is informed through the E2E error handler (see chapter [7.7.2.3.3](#e2e-error-notification)). In this case no value is retrieved from Publisher.

If the incoming message is received without E2E error, the GetHandler of the Publisher application is called.

Independent of the result of the E2E check a response message is sent to the client (caller of the Get() function). The message sent back to the client has message type type RESPONSE and return code either (OK) or (ERROR).

This response message is E2E protected the same way as the Get() message as described in chapters [7.7.2.4.1](#serializing-the-e2e-error-response-payload), [7.7.2.4.2](#serializing-the-response-payload) and [7.7.2.4.3](#e2e-protection-of-the-response-payload).

![](./media/image91.png)

**Figure 7.34:** **Receive a GET Message**

### Receive a response to a GET message

The reception of an E2E protected response message is described in chapter [7.7.2.5](#e2e-checking-the-service-method-response-client).

If the message is received with an E2E error, then the E2E Errorhandler of the client is called. The future of the Get() function is set to ready state with an error code. That is described in chapter [7.7.2.5](#e2e-checking-the-service-method-response-client).

The received message is of type RESPONSE or ERROR (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00055]). Type ERROR indicates that an E2E error occurred at the server site. If a message of type ERROR is received with Return Code of E2E error (indicating that the Publisher received the Get request with an E2E error) then the E2E Errorhandler of the Client Application is called. The future of the Get() function is set to ready state with an error code.

It is up to the Client application how to react to a call of its Errorhandler.

If the RESPONSE message is received without E2E errors then the future is updated with the received value of the Publishers field. The future becomes ready and the Client application can use this value.

If a RESPONSE message to an outgoing Get message does not arrive at all, then the client application is not informed if the value was retrieved from the remote application. The future of Field.Get() is not updated to state ready. In this case the client application can send the Get message again to the remote application to retrieve the value, or initiate its own error handling. A timeout supervision (chapter [7.7.2.6](#timeout-supervision)) may unlock the future. Figure [7.35](#_bookmark397) shows reception of a message from the server.

![](./media/image96.png)Client Application


**Figure 7.35:** **Receive response to a GET Message**

### Send a SET message

The E2E serialization follows the specification of [[SWS_CM_90458](#_bookmark359)]. Only one parameter is serialized: The parameter to be set at the publisher application.

The parameters dataID, sourceID, messageType and messageResult for

E2E_XXmProtect method are passed as described in chapter [7.7.2.2.2](#e2e-protection-of-the-payload).

After E2E protection the non E2E protected part is added to message as described in specification [[SWS_CM_10464](#_bookmark361)].

Figure [7.36](#_bookmark399) shows the message flow of sending a Set() method. The figure does not list all details of E2E protection, e.g. functions of libraries E2ELib and CrcLib are omitted in this figure.

![](./media/image102.png)The client application calls the Set() function at ara::com with one argument (the value that shall overwrite the field's value).

![](./media/image103.png)

**Figure 7.36:** **Send a SET Message**

### Receive a SET message

The message is received by the Publisher application. The Publisher application is a server application.

The E2E check of the received message follows the specification of chapter [7.7.2.3](#e2e-checking-the-service-method-request-server).

If the incoming message is received without E2E error the SetHandler of the Publisher application is called. The SetHandler returns the value to be written to the Publisher's field. The returned value may be identical to the parameter of the SET message (successful update). But there is also the possibility that an update could not be performed completely. If the parameter of the SET message is out of range then the field may be left unchanged or the field is updated by a value inside the field's range. The type of the response message is RESPONSE.

If the incoming message is received with an E2E error, then the Publisher is informed through the E2E error handler (see chapter [7.7.2.3.3](#e2e-error-notification)). In this case The SetHandler of the Publisher is not called. The type of the response message is ERROR. If the E2E_Check fails the Return Code of the ERROR message is initialized with an E2E error code (See [PRS_SOMEIP_00191]).

The type of the message to be sent back to the client is RESPONSE or ERROR. That depends on the result of the E2E check.

The message to be returned (type ERROR or RESPONSE) is serialized, E2E protected and sent back to the client.

This response message is E2E protected the same way as the Get() message as described in chapters [7.7.2.4.1](#serializing-the-e2e-error-response-payload), [7.7.2.4.2](#serializing-the-response-payload) and [7.7.2.4.3](#e2e-protection-of-the-response-payload).

Figure [7.37](#_bookmark401) shows the reception of a SET message. The E2E protected part of the serialized header is checked for E2E errors. If the incoming message was received with an E2E error, then the Publisher is informed through the E2E error handler. The Publisher's field is not updated and no value is retrieved from Publisher's field.

![](./media/image85.png)

**Figure 7.37:** **Receive a SET Message**

### Receive a response to a SET message

The reception of an E2E protected response message is described in chapter [7.7.2.5](#e2e-checking-the-service-method-response-client).

If the message is received with an E2E error, then the Errorhandler of the client is called. The future of the Set() function is set to ready state with an error code ().That is described in chapter [7.7.2.5.3](#e2e-error-notification-1).

The received message is of type RESPONSE or ERROR (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00055]). Type ERROR indicates that an E2E error occurred at the server site. If a message of type ERROR is received with Return Code of E2E error (indicating that the Publisher received the Set request with an E2E error) then the Errorhandler of the Client Application is called. The future of the Set() function is set to ready state with an error code.

It is up to the Client application how to react to a call of its Errorhandler.

If the RESPONSE message is received without E2E errors then the future is updated with the received value of Publisher's field. The future becomes ready and the Client application can use this value.

If a RESPONSE message to an outgoing Set message does not arrive at all then the client application is not informed about the value which is set at the remote application. The future of Field.Set() is not updated to state ready. In this case the client application can send the Set message again to the remote application in order to set the intended value and receive the set value or initiate its own error handling. A timeout supervision (chapter [7.7.2.6](#timeout-supervision)) can unlock the future.

Figure [7.38](#_bookmark403) shows reception of a response. This message is of type RESPONSE or ERROR (see [PRS_SOMEIP_00055]) and similar to the reception of a response to a GET message.

![](./media/image96.png)Client Application


**Figure 7.38:** **Receive response to a SET Message**

### Send an UPDATE message

The application triggers the sending of update messages to subscribers. The update of a field's value by a SetHandler() is a reason to trigger update messages.

An update of a subscriber is an event. The E2E protection of an update is described in chapter [7.7.1.2](#publisher). The update message is sent to every subscriber to the publisher's field.

Figure [7.39](#_bookmark405) shows sending of field update messages.

![](./media/image98.png)

**Figure 7.39:** **Send an UPDATE Message**

### Receive an UPDATE message

The loop over samples indicates that more than one update messages are collected and evaluated by E2E state machine. In the case of E2E fields this is rather a theoretical option. Usually the number of received update messages is zero or one.

The reception of E2E protected fields is described in chapter [7.7.1.3](#subscriber---getnewsamples).

The reception of E2E protected fields follows the principle of E2E protected events (see figure [7.27](#_bookmark345) in chapter [7.7.1](#end-to-end-communication-protection-for-events)). This reception of E2E protected fields demands periodic communication.

If one or more update messages are received the E2E state machine provides one of the following results: OK, ERROR, REPEATED, NONEWDATA, WRONGSEQUENCE (See [PRS_E2E_00597]). Only result OK indicates that the received value is valid.

Figure [7.40](#_bookmark407) shows reception of a field update message.

**Figure 7.40:** **Receive an UPDATE Message**

## Functional cluster lifecycle

The Communication Management functional cluster provides the primary communication infrastructure for Adaptive AUTOSAR, which is used by State Management. Because the interaction between State Management and Execution Management has a key impact on the lifecycle of the entire Adaptive AUTOSAR platform, the availability of communication infrastructure is essential for system state changes. AUTOSAR assumes the availability of this communication in the states Startup and Shutdown to the extent necessary to perform these states.

### Startup

No special startup handling is needed for the Communication Management functional cluster. However, Communication Management provides the communication infrastructure used by State Management. Therefore, it is recommended to start Communication Management in parallel with Execution Management or after starting Execution Management but before starting State Management. Once State Management and Execution Management are operational, they should take control of the Communication Management lifecycle.

Please note that the specific implementation details and configuration of Language Binding, Communication Binding and Network Binding made by the integrator affects the specific requirements for a given deployment.

### Shutdown

Control over this state of the Communication Management functional cluster lifecycle should be handled by State Management and Execution Management. However, Communication Management provides the communication infrastructure used by State Management. Therefore, the Communication Management functional cluster should maintain the functionality required by State Management as long as it is necessary.

Please note that the specific implementation details and configuration of Language Binding, Communication Binding, and Network Binding affects the shutdown strategy for a particular deployment. It is the responsibility of the system integrator to carefully consider when the Communication Management elements will terminate to ensure the success of the system shutdown and notification of Applications. In particular the system integrator should provide a concept how to notify application processes still holding SamplePtr's to memory elements of communication management.

## Communication Interfaces

ara::com is the interface that AUTOSAR Adaptive Applications use to interact with the Communication Management.

In this chapter, the functional specifications for the communication interfaces of ara::com are described. The actual C++ APIs of ara::com are described in chapter [8](#communication-api-specification).

### Offer service

For the service offering C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.2](#offer-service-1).

**[SWS_CM_00102]**{DRAFT} **Uniqueness of offered service on local machine** *[*Upon a call to OfferService() the Communication Management shall check the offered service for uniqueness on the local machine using information available to the service discovery. If the implementation detects a duplication (i.e., a service with the same serviceInstanceId, serviceInterfaceId and majorVersion on the same VLAN (e.g.according to [constr_1723] of [6]) is already registered, the requested service offering shall not start, and the function shall return positively after error is logged.*â™© (RS_CM_00200, RS_CM_00101, RS_CM_00108)*

**Note: System/vehicle-wide Uniqueness of offered service** (see [RS_CM_00108]); System/vehicle-wide uniqueness should be targeted in a best-effort way, i.e., if knowledge about a a remotely offered service is available, this knowledge shall be used in the uniqueness check.

**[SWS_CM_00103] Network binding where a service is offered** *[*When a new service is offered by the application, the Communication Management shall check over which network binding this service shall be offered. This information is configured in the class of ServiceInterfaceDeployment referencing the offered ServiceInterface in the role serviceInterface. If the class is SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment then the Some/IP network binding shall handle the OfferService call as described in [[SWS_CM_00203](#_bookmark45)]. If the class is DdsServiceInterfaceDeployment, then the DDS network binding shall handle the OfferService call as described in [[SWS_CM_11001](#_bookmark197)]. If the class is UserDefinedServiceInterfaceDeployment, the Communication Management implementer is responsible for implementing the OfferService method in an appropriate way.*â™©(RS_CM_00101)*

**[SWS_CM_00104]**{DRAFT} **Network binding for StopOfferService** *[*When a service calls StopOfferService, the Communication Management shall check over which network binding the offered service shall be stopped. This information is configured in the class of ServiceInterfaceDeployment referencing the offered ServiceInterface in the role serviceInterface. If the class is SomeipServiceInterfaceDeployment then the Some/IP network binding shall handle the mapping of the StopOfferService method as described in [[SWS_CM_00204](#_bookmark46)]. If the class is DdsServiceInterfaceDeployment, then the DDS network binding shall

handle the mapping of the StopOfferService as described in [[SWS_CM_11005](#_bookmark207)]. If the class is UserDefinedServiceInterfaceDeployment, the Communication Management implementer is responsible for implementing the StopOfferService method in an appropriate way.*â™©(RS_CM_00101)*

### Service skeleton creation

For the service skeleton creation C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.3](#service-skeleton-creation-1).

**[SWS_CM_10410] InstanceIdentifier check during the creation of service skeleton** *[*The Communication Management shall check the value of the InstanceIdentifier argument: the identifier shall be unique. If the same InstanceIdentifier is used for the creation of more than one skeleton instance of the same service shall be handled as violation according to [SWS_CORE_00003].*â™©(RS_CM_00101)*

**[SWS_CM_10450] InstanceSpecifier check during the creation of service skeleton** *[*The Communication Management shall check the value of the InstanceSpecifier argument: the specifier shall be unique, using the same instance specifier for the creation of more than one skeleton instance of the same service shall be handled as violation according to [SWS_CORE_00003].*â™©(RS_CM_00101, RS_AP_00137)*

**[SWS_CM_10451] InstanceIdentifierContainer check during the creation of service skeleton** *[*The Communication Management shall check the value of the InstanceIdentifierContainer argument:

- the container size shall be bigger than zero
- the identifiers of the container shall be unique
- the identifiers of the container shall correspond to the same instance specifier.

If there are failing checks, and the same InstanceIdentifier is used for the creation of more than one skeleton instance of the same service shall be handled as violation according to [SWS_CORE_00003].*â™©(RS_CM_00101)*

### Send event

For the event sending C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.4](#send-event-1).

To support sending of events where the data is owned by the application and continuously updated and the data is explicitly created for sending, the Send method shall be provided in two ways: One where the application is owner of the data and the Send method makes a copy for sending and one where Communication Management is responsible for the data and the application is not allowed to do anything with the data after sending.

**[SWS_CM_99031] Send event where application is responsible for the data** *[*As defined in [[SWS_CM_00162](#sws_cm_00162-send-event-where-application-is-responsible-for-the-data)], the Send method of the specific Event class where the application is responsible for the data and the Communication Management creates a copy for sending shall be used whenever the application wants to work further with the data.*â™©(RS_CM_00201)*

**[SWS_CM_99032] Send event where Communication Management is responsible for the data** *[*As defined in [[SWS_CM_90437](#_bookmark532)], the Send method of the specific Event class where the Communication Management is responsible for the data and the application is not allowed to access the data after sending shall be used whenever the data is created explicitly for sending and no further processing is happening afterward by the application itself.

Before sending the event, the corresponding data has to be requested from the Communication Management (see [[SWS_CM_99033](#_bookmark415)]) and filled with the respective data.*â™© (RS_CM_00201)*

**[SWS_CM_99033] Allocating data for event transfer** *[*Data shall be requested by calling the Allocate method of the specific Event class as defined in [[SWS_CM_90438](#sws_cm_90438-allocate-data-when-communication-management-is-responsi--ble-for-the-data)]. By calling the Send method with the data, it is ensured that the data will be freed by the Communication Management.*â™©(RS_CM_00201)*

**[SWS_CM_99034]** *[*Since the SampleAllocateePtr pointer type behaves like a std::unique_ptr, the ownership of the pointer has to be transferred via std::move for utilizing zero-copy optimizations.*â™©(RS_CM_00201)*

### Processing of service methods

For the processing of service methods C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.7](#processing-of-service-methods-1).

The *Method Call Processing Mode* defined in [[SWS_CM_00198](#sws_cm_00198draft-set-service-method-processing-mode)] allows the implementation providing the service method to select how the incoming service method invocations are processed. The selection is valid for all the methods of the specific ServiceSkeleton instance.

**[SWS_CM_10411]**{DRAFT} **Service method processing modes** *[*The following service method processing modes shall be supported:

- **Polling**: Instead of calling a provided service method, the Communication Management software collects incoming service method invocations. The processing of each invocation is explicitly triggered by the implementation providing the service method using the mechanism defined in [[SWS_CM_00199](#sws_cm_00199-process-service-method-invocation)].
- **Event-driven, concurrent**: The Communication Management software activates the invoked service method when the invocation arrives. Consumer concurrent calls are allowed and will be processed concurrently on provider side by using different threads.

This is the default mode.

- **Event-driven, sequential**: The Communication Management software activates the invoked service method when the invocation arrives. Consumer concurrent

calls are allowed, but will not be processed concurrently on provider side, by instead executing them one after the other to avoid the need of synchronization mechanisms in the implementation providing the service method.

*â™©(RS_CM_00211)*

The ProcessNextMethodCall defined in [[SWS_CM_00199](#sws_cm_00199-process-service-method-invocation)] allows the implementation providing the service method to trigger the execution of the next service consumer method call at a specific point of time if the processing mode is set to Polling.

### Registering get handlers for fields

For the registering get handlers for fields C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.8](#registering-get-handlers-for-fields-1).

**[SWS_CM_10412]**{DRAFT} **Invoking GetHandlers** *[*The registered GetHandler shall be called by the implementation whenever the Communication Management receives a Get.*â™©(RS_CM_00218)*

### Registering set handlers for fields

For the registering set handlers for fields C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.9](#registering-set-handlers-for-fields-1).

**[SWS_CM_10413]**{DRAFT} **Invoking SetHandlers** *[*The registered SetHandler shall be called by the implementation whenever the Communication Management receives a Set.*â™©(RS_CM_00218)*

Note: Upon a call to the SetHandler, the Service Provider has to validate the received field value (it can accept, modify or reject it). After that, it sets the new value in the future object (see [[SWS_CM_00116](#_bookmark546)]). If the SetHandler needs to access the current field value to validate the new field value, the skeleton implementation has to provide a replica of the underlying field value that is accessible from application level.

**[SWS_CM_10415]**{DRAFT} **Notify the Field value after a call to the SetHandler function** *[*The Communication Management implementation shall take the effective field value returned by the SetHandler function, and send it back to the requester as return value of the set function (see [[SWS_CM_00113](#_bookmark591)]), and to all the other subscribed entities via notification (see [[SWS_CM_00119](#_bookmark548)]).*â™©(RS_CM_00218)*

**[SWS_CM_00128]**{DRAFT} **Ensuring the existence of valid Field values** *[*To ensure the existence of a valid field values upon a call to the Subscribe() method (see [[SWS_CM_00141](#_bookmark559)]) or to the Get() method (see [[SWS_CM_00112](#_bookmark588)]) the ara::com implementation shall do the following: If a service containing a Field is offered via a call to OfferService() (see [[SWS_CM_00101](#_bookmark522)]), if Update() has not been called yet and one or more of the following applies:

- hasNotifier = true
- hasGetter = true and a GetHandler (see [[SWS_CM_00114](#_bookmark543)]) has not yet been registered.

Then the error code ComErrc::kFieldValueIsNotValid shall be returned in the result type of OfferService(). The error shall be logged.*â™©(RS_CM_00218)*

**[SWS_CM_00129]**{DRAFT} **Ensuring the existence of SetHandler** *[*Upon a call to OfferService() in a skeleton implementation for a given service, the following error check shall be made: if for at least one contained Field having hasSetter = true no SetHandler (see [[SWS_CM_00116](#_bookmark546)]) has been registered yet, the error code ComErrc::kSetHandlerNotSet shall be returned in the result type of OfferService(). The error shall be logged.*â™©(RS_CM_00218)*

### Find service

For the find service C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.10](#find-service-1).

**[SWS_CM_00124]**{DRAFT} **Find service handler invocation** *[*After calling the StartFindService method, the FindServiceHandler shall be called by the Communication Management software to receive the found services. By the first call, the FindServiceHandler shall receive the initially known matches, if there are any. In following, the FindServiceHandler shall be called every time the availability of any of the services matching the given instance criteria changes.*â™©(RS_CM_00102)*

**[SWS_CM_10382]**{DRAFT} **Calling stop find service for already stopped finds** *[*Calls to the StopFindService method using a FindServiceHandle obtained from a StartFindService that already has been stopped shall be silently ignored.*â™© (RS_CM_00102)*

### Service proxy creation

For the service proxy creation C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.11](#service-proxy-creation-1).

**[SWS_CM_10491]**{DRAFT} **Re-establishing service connection** *[*In case the service becomes temporarily unavailable (due to restart, network problem or so), or if an error occurs while establishing a connection to the service, the error shall be logged, and the Communication Management shall retry to establish the connection once the next offer is received.*â™©(RS_CM_00102, RS_CM_00107)*

### Service proxy destruction

**[SWS_CM_10446]**{DRAFT} **Destruction of service proxy** *[*The destructor of each specific ServiceProxy class shall destroy the Promise instances corresponding to the Future instances returned by the function call operator (operator()) of the respective Method class (see [[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)]) or by the Get or Set method of the respective Field class (see [[SWS_CM_00112](#_bookmark588)] and [[SWS_CM_00113](#_bookmark591)]) by explicitly or implicitly invoking the destructor of the Promise (see [SWS_CORE_00349]). This in turn will make the corresponding Future ready (if this is not already the case) with an ara::core::ErrorCode (see [SWS_CORE_00501]) where the error domain is set to ara::core::FutureErrorDomain (see [SWS_CORE_00421]) and the value is set to broken_promise (see [SWS_CORE_00400]).*â™©(RS_CM_00102, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00127, RS_AP_00145)*

### Service event subscription

For the service event subscription C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.12](#service-event-subscription-1).

**[SWS_CM_00700]**{DRAFT} **Ensure memory allocation of maxSampleCount samples** *[*The Communication Management shall ensure, that after returning from method Subscribe sufficient memory resources are available, so that the number of samples given in parameter maxSampleCount can be concurrently accessed by application layer.*â™©(RS_CM_00103)*

**[SWS_CM_99035] Set Subscription State change handler** *[*The handler SetSubscriptionStateChangeHandler defined in [[SWS_CM_00333](#sws_cm_00333-set-subscription-state-change-handler)] shall be called by the Communication Management implementation as soon as the subscription state of this event has changed. Handler may be overwritten during runtime.*â™©(RS_CM_00106)*

**[SWS_CM_00313] Call SubscriptionStateChangeHandler with kSubscriptionPending** *[*The Communication Management shall call the SubscriptionStateChangeHandler with the value kSubscriptionPending in the following cases:

- the client subscribes to an event and the actual subscription does not happen immediately (e.g. due to a bus protocol)
- the client is subscribed to an event and Communication Management has detected that the server instance is currently not available (due to restart, network problem or so)

*â™©(RS_CM_00103, RS_CM_00104, RS_CM_00106, RS_CM_00107)*

Note: Method Calls may lead to a kServiceNotAvailable error [[SWS_CM_11264](#_bookmark495)] at that time.

**[SWS_CM_00314] Call SubscriptionStateChangeHandler with kSubscribed** *[*The Communication Management shall call the SubscriptionStateChangeHandler with the value kSubscribed in the following cases:

- the client subscribes to an event and the actual subscription is established successfully
- the client is subscribed to an event and the actual subscription is re-established again after being temporarily unavailable (due to restart, network problem or so)

*â™©(RS_CM_00103, RS_CM_00104, RS_CM_00106, RS_CM_00107)*

**[SWS_CM_00315] Re-establishing an active subscription** *[*The Communication Management shall re-establish the actual subscription again after the server service being temporarily unavailable (due to restart, network problem or so). This shall work independently of whether a network binding is involved or not. The reestablishment shall also provide a possible update of binding specific connection properties if needed.*â™©(RS_CM_00103, RS_CM_00104, RS_CM_00106, RS_CM_00107)*

### Receive event

For the event data access C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.13](#receive-event-1).

**[SWS_CM_00703] Sequence of actions in GetNewSamples** *[*In the context of the GetNewSamples call, the Communication Management shall do the following steps repeatedly:

- get next received event data sample from underlying receive buffers.
- de-serialize the data, if needed.
- place the de-serialized data sample of type SampleType in the local cache.
- call user provided f with a SamplePtr (including ProfileCheckStatus) referencing the data sample located in local cache.

until at least one of the following conditions is true:

- maxNumberOfSamples have already been fetched from the underlying receive buffers within this GetNewSamples call.
- maxSampleCount reached. I.e. the application is currently holding exactly as many SamplePtrs provided by this Event class instance, than it has committed in call to Subscribe via maxSampleCount.
- no new data samples available from underlying receive buffers.

*â™©(RS_CM_00202)*

### [SWS_CM_00707] Calculation of Free Sample Count *[*

- After call to Subscribe with parameter maxSampleCount set to N and *before* any call to GetNewSamples on the same Event class instance, a call to GetFreeSampleCount shall return N.
- Each SamplePtr created by the Communication Middleware in the context of a call to GetNewSamples on the same Event class instance shall lead to a decrement of count of free samples.
- Each destruction or std::nullptr_t assignment (see [[SWS_CM_00306](#_bookmark478)]) of a SamplePtr instance created from this Event class instance shall lead to an increment of count of free samples.

*â™©(RS_CM_00202)*

**[SWS_CM_00709] FIFO semantics** *[*The Communication Management shall provide buffering with FIFO semantics between sender and receiver of events.*â™©(RS_CM_00203)*

**[SWS_CM_00710]**{DRAFT} **No implicit context switches** *[*Reception of a new event shall not lead to an implicit context switch in the receiver process when polling behavior is employed (i.e. No ReceiveHandler has been set via SetReceiveHandler())*â™© (RS_CM_00203)*

### Receive event by polling

For the polling access no additional APIs on top of [8.1.3.13](#receive-event-1) are needed.

### Receive event by getting triggered

For the receive event by getting triggered C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.13.1](#receive-event-by-getting-triggered-1).

**[SWS_CM_00182]**{DRAFT} **Event Receive Handler call serialization** *[*The Communication Management shall serialize calls to the registered EventReceiveHandler function as it is not guaranteed that the callback function is re-entrant.*â™©(RS_CM_00203)*

**[SWS_CM_00711]**{DRAFT} *[*After the Communication Management has called the registered EventReceiveHandler function for a specific Event class instance, the next call to GetNewSamples on the same instance shall provide at least one data sample as long as GetFreeSampleCount is not already returning 0 at the point in time of the call.*â™©(RS_CM_00203)*

### Service trigger subscription

For the service trigger subscription C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.14](#service-trigger-subscription-1).

Getting subscription state and set a subscription change handler for Trigger is the same as for Event. The following specification are also valid for Trigger:

```
- [[SWS_CM_00316](#_bookmark561)] Query Subscription State.
- [[SWS_CM_00024](#_bookmark562)] Reentrancy GetSubscriptionState.
- [[SWS_CM_00333](#sws_cm_00333-set-subscription-state-change-handler)] Set Subscription State change handler.
- [[SWS_CM_11354](#_bookmark564)] Execution Context for setting Subscription State change handler.
- [[SWS_CM_11355](#_bookmark565)] Error behavior of provided Execution Context for setting Subscription State change handler.
- [[SWS_CM_00025](#_bookmark566)] Reentrancy SetSubscriptionStateChangeHandler.
- [[SWS_CM_00334](#_bookmark567)] Unset Subscription State change handler.
- [[SWS_CM_00026](#_bookmark568)] Reentrancy UnsetSubscriptionStateChangeHandler.
- [[SWS_CM_00313](#_bookmark425)] Call SubscriptionStateChangeHandler with kSubscriptionPending.
- [[SWS_CM_00314](#_bookmark426)] Call SubscriptionStateChangeHandler with kSubscribed.
- [[SWS_CM_00315](#_bookmark427)] Re-establishing an active subscription.
```

  1. ### Receive trigger

For the trigger data access C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.15](#receive-trigger-1).

**[SWS_CM_00227]**{DRAFT} **Sequence of actions in GetNewTriggers** *[*In the context of the GetNewTriggers (see [[SWS_CM_00226](#_bookmark582)]) call, the Communication Management shall get the number of triggers occurred since the last call of GetNewTriggers.*â™©(RS_CM_00202)*

### Receive trigger by getting triggered

For the receive event by getting triggered C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.15.1](#receive-trigger-by-getting-triggered-1). The following specification are also valid for Trigger

- [[SWS_CM_00028](#_bookmark575)] Reentrancy SetReceiveHandler
- [[SWS_CM_00183](#_bookmark576)] Disable service event trigger
- [[SWS_CM_00029](#_bookmark577)] Reentrancy UnsetReceiveHandler

  1. ### Call a service method

For the call a service method C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.16](#call-a-service-method-1).

**[SWS_CM_10414]**{DRAFT} **Initiate a method call** *[*At the point of time when the caller calls the method (see [[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)]), the Communication Management software does not know yet if the result shall be returned with synchronous or asynchronous behavior. Therefore the Communication Management software shall instantiate the ara::core::Future object to be returned to the caller, but shall not perform actions which lead to uncontrolled context switches from the caller point of view, e.g. an asynchronous event-style mechanism for a wait-on-event.*â™©(RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213, RS_AP_00138)*

**[SWS_CM_10371]**{DRAFT} **Context of return checked errors** *[*If during processing of a method call one of the checked errors occurs, the corresponding ara::core::ErrorCode shall be returned in the context of the ara::core::Future::GetResult()/ara::core::Future::get() call.*â™©(RS_CM_00211, RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213, RS_CM_00214)*

See [subsubsection](#error-types) [8.1.2.7](#error-types)) for the definition of checked errors.

**[SWS_CM_90436]**{DRAFT} **No checked errors for Fire and Forget method calls** *[*There shall be no checked errors returned for Fire and Forget method calls.*â™©(RS_CM_00225)*

**[SWS_CM_00194]**{DRAFT} **Cancel the method call** *[*The destructor of the returned ara::core::Future object shall be used by the caller to cancel the request after issuing a method call. Deleting the returned ara::core::Future object shall result in the abort of the method call and ensure that any related buffers are released and no result is returned to the caller.*â™©(RS_CM_00212, RS_CM_00213, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00127)*

This is a mechanism on client side to tell the Communication Management software that the caller is not interested in the method result anymore. Cancellation of the method call is not propagated to the server side execution of the method.

**[SWS_CM_00195]**{DRAFT} **Retrieving results of the method call** *[*The method GetResult() of the returned ara::core::Future object shall be used to retrieve the result of the method call as ara::core::Result. The call of the method GetResult() will block if there is not yet a result available and will return after the result has been received returning an object of the respective Output or an error. As an alternative, get() returns the contained object of the result from GetResult(), or throws the contained error as exception, respectively.*â™©(RS_CM_00212, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00120, RS_AP_00138, RS_AP_00128, RS_AP_00127, RS_AP_00139)*

**[SWS_CM_00192]**{DRAFT} **Synchronous behavior of method call** *[*To achieve synchronous behavior of the method call, the methods of ara::core::Future object with blocking behavior shall be used because they only return when the output of the method call according to [[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)] is available: get(), wait(), wait_for (), wait_until(). With the call of one of these methods and the result still pending, the Communication Management software is allowed to perform actions which lead to uncontrolled context switches from the caller point of view, e.g. an asynchronous event-style mechanism for a wait-on-event.*â™©(RS_CM_00212, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00120, RS_AP_00138, RS_AP_00128, RS_AP_00127, RS_AP_00138)*

Note that there are situations where the methods of an ara::core::Future object with blocking behavior will block forever. The adaptive application will need to gracefully handle such a situation. Prominent examples for such situations are the following ones:

- the request message or the response message of the (remote) service method call gets lost
- the implementation for the service method in the subclass of the respective ServiceSkeleton (see [[SWS_CM_00194](#_bookmark436)]) does not return (i.e., hangs)

ara::com will **not** internally perform some kind of timeout supervision in order to eventually unblock those blocking ara::core::Future methods. If such a timeout supervision is desired from the perspective of the adaptive application, it is up to the adaptive application to implement according mechanisms, e.g., by using the wait_for (), wait_until(), or the is_ready() methods of the ara::core::Future.

On the other hand there are situations where the ara::com implementation on the client side **knows** that an issued (remote) service method call will not succeed and thus would block forever. Prominent examples for such situations are the following ones:

- the sending of request message of the (remote) service method failed locally (i.e., the corresponding system or library call indicated an error)
- the received response message partly contains malformed message content but contains sufficient correct information allowing to determine the method this response is targeted at (i.e., there is sufficient information available about who to notify/which ara::core::Future to fulfill) -in case of the SOME/IP network binding (see Section [7.5.1](#someip-network-binding)) this would be a response message where the layer 2 and layer 4 checksums are correct the SOME/IP header (which contains the method ID) is intact (e.g., in case of a SOME/IP response message, the checks described in [[SWS_CM_10313](#_bookmark85)] are passed ) the de-serialization of the payload fails though

**[SWS_CM_10440]**{DRAFT} **Aborting method calls in case of locally detected failures** *[*To notify the adaptive application about locally detected failures which prevent an issued (remote) service method call from succeeding, the ara::com implementation shall make the Future returned by the function call operator (operator()) of the respective Method class (see [[SWS_CM_00196](#_bookmark586)]) or by the Get or Set method of the respective Field class (see [[SWS_CM_00112](#_bookmark588)] and [[SWS_CM_00113](#_bookmark591)]) ready by invoking the SetError (see [SWS_CORE_00353]) operation of the Promise corresponding to this Future with an ara::core::ErrorCode (see [SWS_CORE_00501]) where the error domain is set to ara::com::ComErrorDomain (see [[SWS_CM_11264](#_bookmark495)]) and the value is set to kNetworkBindingFailure (see [[SWS_CM_10432](#_bookmark496)]) as an argument.*â™©(RS_CM_00213, RS_CM_00214, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00119, RS_AP_00127)*

**[SWS_CM_00193]**{DRAFT} **Asynchronous behavior of method call with polling** *[*To achieve asynchronous behavior of the method call with polling on the result availability, the non-blocking method is_ready() of ara::core::Future object shall be used. If is_ready() returns true, the next call of get() shall not block, but immediately return the valid value.*â™©(RS_CM_00213, RS_CM_00214, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00127)*

### Note:

When the user just calls is_ready() of ara::core::Future and on positive response, finally GetResult()/get() of ara::core::Future, retrieving the result works polling-based without any overhead in the middleware and uncontrolled context switches due to asynchronous event-style mechanisms.

**[SWS_CM_00197]**{DRAFT} **Asynchronous behavior of method call with notification** *[*To achieve asynchronous behavior of the method call with event-driven notification on the result availability, the non-blocking method then() of ara::core::Future object shall be used. It allows to register a function, which gets asynchronously called in case the future has a valid result.*â™©(RS_CM_00213, RS_CM_00215, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00127, RS_AP_00138)*

### Update notification events for fields

**[SWS_CM_00120]**{DRAFT} **Provision of an update notification event for a Field** *[*If hasNotifier is true, update notification events for the Field shall be provided as of the following requirements:

- [[SWS_CM_00141](#_bookmark559)] Method to subscribe to a service event. This subscribe leads immediately to a service event that contains the initial field value send from provider side to the consumer.
- [[SWS_CM_00151](#_bookmark560)] Method to unsubscribe from a service event.
- [[SWS_CM_00316](#_bookmark561)] Method to query the subscription state.
- [[SWS_CM_00701](#_bookmark570)] Method to receive a service event using polling.
- [[SWS_CM_00181](#_bookmark573)] Method to enable service event trigger.
- [[SWS_CM_00182](#_bookmark431)] Event Receive Handler call serialization.
- [[SWS_CM_00183](#_bookmark576)] Method to disable service event trigger.
- [[SWS_CM_00333](#sws_cm_00333-set-subscription-state-change-handler)] Method to set a subscription state change handler.
- [[SWS_CM_00334](#_bookmark567)] Method to unset a subscription state change handler.

Except that the corresponding methods reside in the Field class instead of the Event class.*â™©(RS_CM_00218)*

### Instance Specifier Translation

For the instance specifier translation C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.19](#instance-specifier-translation-1).

**[SWS_CM_10452]**{DRAFT} **InstanceSpecifier translation to InstanceIdentifiers** *[*The Communication Management shall translate an InstancSpecifier to InstanceIdentifiers. Based on the match there shall be zero, 1 or multiple InstanceIdentifiers .*â™©(RS_CM_00200, RS_AP_00137)*

### API Data Types

This chapter describes the functionality of the data types used by the ara::com API, both the specific ones which are part of the standardized proxy and skeleton interfaces, and the ones derived from the description based on the AUTOSAR meta-model.

### Service Identifier Data Types

For the Service Identifier Data Types C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.2.1](#service-identifier-data-types-1).

The data types described in this chapter are used to identify a specific service or service instance.

There might exist different instances of exactly the same service in the system. To handle this, an InstanceIdentifier or an InstanceSpecifier are used to identify a specific instance of a service.

An InstanceIdentifier (see [[SWS_CM_00302](#sws_cm_00302draft-instance-identifier-class)]) is a unique identifier of a specific instance of a service, needed to distinguish different instances of exactly the same service in the system. It contains instance information and information about the service type. This will make the InstanceIdentifier unique for different instances.

A service can be identified at least by a fully qualified name and a version.

**[SWS_CM_99029]**{DRAFT} **Service Contract Version** *[*The value of the service contract major version (serviceContractVersionMajor) shall be derived from the majorVersion attribute in the ServiceInterface. The value of the service contract minor version (serviceContractVersionMinor) shall be derived from the minorVersion attribute in the ServiceInterface.*â™©(RS_CM_00500)*

The following data types are used for the handling of services on the service consumer side.

**[SWS_CM_99030]**{DRAFT} **Find Service Handle** *[*To identify a triggered request to find a service, the StartFindService method of [[SWS_CM_00123](#_bookmark552)] shall return a FindServiceHandle which is used as parameter to cancel this request with StopFindService as described in [[SWS_CM_00125](#_bookmark555)].*â™©(RS_CM_00102, RS_AP_00122, RS_AP_00119)*

The usage of the API to find service instances, as defined in [[SWS_CM_00122](#_bookmark550)] and [[SWS_CM_00123](#_bookmark552)], provides a *handle container* (see [[SWS_CM_00319](#_bookmark469)]) holding a list of *handle*s. Each *handle* represents an existing service instance and by passing the *handle* as parameter to the proxy constructor [[SWS_CM_00131](#_bookmark557)], it allows the ara::com API user to create a proxy instance to access this service instance.

### Event Related Data Types

For the Event Related Data Types C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.2.2](#event-related-data-types-1).

Event handling on receiver side is based on queued communication with configurable cache sizes. The cache size for a specific event of a proxy instance is determined by the Communication Management, when subscribing to a specific event by [[SWS_CM_00141](#_bookmark559)].

After the receiver subscribed to an event, the method GetNewSamples, as defined in [[SWS_CM_00701](#_bookmark570)], is used to retrieve the *data samples* of that event. In the context of GetNewSamples application provided callback functions are called by the Communication Management, where *Sample Pointer* s to the data samples retrieved from underlying queues are passed in. A *Sample Pointer* (see [[SWS_CM_00306](#_bookmark478)]) is an alias for an event data type pointer.

On the event provider side, it is possible to let the Communication Management allocate the memory for the storage of the data before sending it as defined in [[SWS_CM_90438](#sws_cm_90438-allocate-data-when-communication-management-is-responsi--ble-for-the-data)]. A *Sample Allocatee Pointer* (see [[SWS_CM_00308](#_bookmark480)]) is an alias for an event data type pointer used both for allocation and data sending.

The event receiver can register an *Event Receive Handler* (see [[SWS_CM_00309](#_bookmark481)]) as a callback to get notified if new event data has arrived. The callback function itself is defined in the event consumer implementation; the *Event Receive Handler* type is just an general purpose function alias for the use in the method SetReceiveHandler as defined by [[SWS_CM_00181](#_bookmark573)].

The event receiver can monitor the state of a service event subscription by requesting or getting a notification of the *Subscription State* (see [[SWS_CM_00310](#_bookmark482)], [[SWS_CM_00316](#_bookmark561)] and [[SWS_CM_00311](#_bookmark483)]), as the real process of subscription might happen at a later point in time than the return of the call to Subscribe. The *Subscription State* related ara::com API methods require the definitions of a *Subscription State* enumeration ([[SWS_CM_00310](#_bookmark482)]) and a *Subscription State Changed Handler* function wrapper.

### Trigger Related Data Types

For the Trigger Related Data Types C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.2.3](#trigger-related-data-types-1).

The trigger receiver can register a *Trigger Receive Handler* (see [[SWS_CM_00351](#_bookmark485)]) as a callback to get notified if new trigger has arrived. The callback function itself is defined in the trigger consumer implementation; the *Trigger Receive Handler* type is just an general purpose function alias for the use in the method SetReceiveHandler as defined by [[SWS_CM_00249](#_bookmark584)].

The trigger receiver can monitor the state of a service trigger subscription by requesting or getting a notification of the *Subscription State* (see [[SWS_CM_00310](#_bookmark482)], [[SWS_CM_00316](#_bookmark561)] and [[SWS_CM_00311](#_bookmark483)]), as the real process of subscription might happen at a later point in time than the return of the call to Subscribe. The *Subscription State* related ara::com API methods require the definitions of a *Subscription State* enumeration ([[SWS_CM_00310](#_bookmark482)]) and a *Subscription State Changed Handler* function wrapper.

The [[SWS_CM_00310](#_bookmark482)] and [[SWS_CM_00311](#_bookmark483)] are also valid for triggers as well.

### Method Related Data Types

For the Method Related Data Types C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.2.4](#method-related-data-types-1).

Service method invocation on provider side can be executed in different processing modes, where the *Method Call Processing Mode* (see [[SWS_CM_00301](#_bookmark487)]) is set as a parameter of the ServiceSkeleton constructor defined by [[SWS_CM_00130](#_bookmark525)].

The expected behavior of each processing mode is described in [[SWS_CM_00198](#sws_cm_00198draft-set-service-method-processing-mode)].

# Communication API specification

While the primary focus of ara::com is targeted towards an implementation in the C++ programming language, the following chapter structures of the document allow for future versions to add further Language Bindings.

1. ## C++ language binding

   1. ### API Header files

This chapter specifies those C++ header files used directly in the API implementation of the ServiceInterface in an Adaptive Application. As part of the Adaptive Platform Methodology, these C++ header files are generated by a workflow tool directly from the ServiceInterface ARXML configuration either as part of the i) *Service/Common/Types Header file* generation, or the ii) *Implementation Types header file* generation [24].

The following requirements are applicable for all header files; requirements which are specific for a header file are described in own sub-chapters.

**[SWS_CM_01020]**{DRAFT} **Common/Service header files directory structure** *[*The *Service header file*s defined by [[SWS_CM_01002](#_bookmark451)] and the *Common header file*s defined by [[SWS_CM_01012](#_bookmark459)] shall be located within the folder:

\<namespace[0]\>/\<namespace[1]\>/\.../\<namespace[n]\>/

where:

\<namespace[0]\> \... \<namespace[n]\> are the namespace names as defined in [[SWS_CM_01005](#_bookmark452)].*â™©(RS_CM_00001, RS_AP_00114)*

**[SWS_CM_12000]**{DRAFT} **Implementation types header files directory structure** *[*The communication management expects the *Implementation Types header file*s generated according to [[SWS_CM_12001](#_bookmark463)] shall be located within the directory according to [SWS_LBAP_00034].*â™©(RS_CM_00001, RS_AP_00114)*

### Service header files

The *Service header file*s are the central definition of the ara::com API and any associated data structures that are required by the AdaptiveApplication software components to use the communication management.

**[SWS_CM_01002]**{DRAFT} **Service header files existence** *[*The communication management shall provide one *Proxy header file* and one *Skeleton header file* for each ServiceInterface defined in the input by using the file name \<name\>_proxy.h for the *Proxy header file* and \<name\>_skeleton.h for the *Skeleton header file*, where \<name\> is the ServiceInterface.shortName converted to lower-case letters.*â™©(RS_CM_00001, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00116)*

**[SWS_CM_01004]**{DRAFT} **Inclusion of common header file** *[*The *Proxy* and *Skeleton header file* shall include the *Common header file*:

```
1 #include \"\<namespace[0]\>/\<namespace[1]\>/\.../\<namespace[n]\>/\<name\>
```

_common.h\"

where:

\<namespace[0]\> \... \<namespace[n]\> are the namespace names as defined in [[SWS_CM_01005](#_bookmark452)] and [SWS_LBAP_00035]. \<name\> is the the ServiceInterface.shortName converted to lower-case letters.*â™©(RS_CM_00001, RS_AP_00114)*

Namespaces are used to separate the definition of services from each other to prevent name conflicts and they allow to use reasonably short names.

**[SWS_CM_01005]**{DRAFT} **Namespace of Service header files** *[*Based on the symbol attributes of the ordered SymbolProps aggregated by PortInterface in role namespace, the C++ namespace of the *Service header file* shall be:

```
1 namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[0].symbol\> {

2 namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[1].symbol\> {

3 namespace \<\...\> {

4 namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[n].symbol\> {

5 \...

6 } // namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[n].symbol\>

7 } // namespace \<\...\>

8 } // namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[1].symbol\>

9 } // namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[0].symbol\>
```

with all namespace names converted to lower-case letters.*â™©(RS_CM_00002, RS_AP_00114)*

Note: In order to avoid name clashes between Events, Fields, and Methods of different ServiceInterfaces in situation where the Events (ServiceInterface.event), Fields (ServiceInterface.field), and Methods (ServiceInterface.method) of the different ServiceInterfaces carry the same shortName, it is highly recommend to place different ServiceInterfaces into dedicated unique C++ namespaces. This is achieved by attaching corresponding ordered SymbolProps to the ServiceInterfaces where the ordered SymbolProps differ in at least one of their symbol attributes.

Starting from the innermost namespace as defined by [[SWS_CM_01005](#_bookmark452)], there are additional C++ namespaces for the proxy or the skeleton and for the events and methods. These namespaces are used for the declarations and definitions as described in chapter [8.1.3](#api-reference).

**[SWS_CM_01006]**{DRAFT} **Service skeleton namespace** *[*The C++ namespace for a specific service skeleton class shall be:

```
1 namespace skeleton {

2 \...

3 } // namespace skeleton
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00002, RS_AP_00114)*

**[SWS_CM_01007]**{DRAFT} **Service proxy namespace** *[*The C++ namespace for a specific service proxy class shall be:

```
1 namespace proxy {

3 } // namespace proxy
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00002, RS_AP_00114)*

**[SWS_CM_01009]**{DRAFT} **Service events namespace** *[*The *Proxy* and *Skeleton header file* shall provide a C++ namespace for the definition of events within the namespace defined by [[SWS_CM_01006](#_bookmark453)] and [[SWS_CM_01007](#_bookmark454)] respectively:

```
1 namespace events {

2 \...

3 } // namespace events
```

*â™©(RS_AP_00114, RS_CM_00002)*

**[SWS_CM_01015]**{DRAFT} **Service methods namespace** *[*The *Proxy* and *Skeleton header file* shall provide a C++ namespace for the definition of methods within the namespace defined by [[SWS_CM_01006](#_bookmark453)] and [[SWS_CM_01007](#_bookmark454)] respectively:

```
1 namespace methods {

2 \...

3 } // namespace methods
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00002, RS_AP_00114)*

**[SWS_CM_01031]**{DRAFT} **Service fields namespace** *[*The *Proxy* and *Skeleton header file* shall provide a C++ namespace for the definition of fields within the namespace defined by [[SWS_CM_01006](#_bookmark453)] and [[SWS_CM_01007](#_bookmark454)] respectively:

```
1 namespace fields {

2 \...

3 } // namespace fields
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00002, RS_CM_00216, RS_AP_00114)*

As a summary of the C++ namespace requirements [[SWS_CM_01005](#_bookmark452)], [[SWS_CM_01006](#_bookmark453)], and [[SWS_CM_01009](#_bookmark455)], the namespace hierarchy in the *Skeleton header file* looks like:

```
1 namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[0].symbol\> {

2 namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[1].symbol\> {

3 namespace \<\...\> {

4 namespace \<ServiceInterface.namespace[n].symbol\> {

5 namespace skeleton {

```

As a summary of the C++ namespace requirements [[SWS_CM_01005](#_bookmark452)], [[SWS_CM_01007](#_bookmark454)], [[SWS_CM_01009](#_bookmark455)], and [[SWS_CM_01015](#_bookmark456)], the namespace hierarchy in the *Proxy header file* looks like:

### Common header file

The *Common header file* includes the ara::com specific type declarations derived from the ApApplicationErrors composed by a particular ServiceInterface as well Service Identifier type declarations related to a particular ServiceInterface.

**[SWS_CM_01012]**{DRAFT} **Common header file existence** *[*The communication management shall provide a *Common header file* for each ServiceInterface defined in the input by using the file name \<name\>_common.h, where \<name\> is the ServiceInterface.shortName converted to lower-case letters.*â™©(RS_CM_00001, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00116)*

where \<namespace[0..n]\> is the namespace hierarchy defined in [SWS_LBAP_00035], and \<symbol\> is the Cpp Implementation Data Type symbol according to [24] converted to lower-case letters.*â™©(RS_CM_00001, RS_AP_00114)*

It is not mandatory that all declarations and definitions are located directly in the *Common header file*. A Communication Management implementation might also distribute the declarations and definitions into different header files, but at least all those header files need to be included into the *Common header file*.

**[SWS_CM_10370]**{DRAFT} **Common header file for Application Errors** *[*The *Common header file* shall include the class definitions for all ApApplicationErrorDomains for the ApApplicationErrors of a ServiceInterface according to [[SWS_CM_11266](#_bookmark500)].*â™©(RS_CM_00001)*

### Types header file

The *Types header file* includes the data type definitions which are specific for the ara::com API. Such data type definitions are used in the standardized proxy and skeleton interfaces defined in chapter [8.1.3](#api-reference).

### Implementation Types header files

As part of the Adaptive Application methodology, all referenced CppImplementationDataTypes in all modeled ServiceInterfaces for a given Adaptive Application, must be processed by an ARA generator to generate the respective C++ language binding representation [29].

The processing rules which specify how an ARA generator shall create the *Implementation Types header files* are specified in detail in [24]. The role of communication management is as a 'consumer' of the respective generated *Implementation Types header files*.

**[SWS_CM_12001]**{DRAFT} **C++ Implementation Data Types files** *[*The communication management shall use the generated *C++ Implementation Types header file*s produced according to:

### API Data Types

This chapter describes the data types used by the ara::com API, both the specific ones which are part of the standardized proxy and skeleton interfaces, and the ones derived from the description based on the AUTOSAR meta-model.

### Service Identifier Data Types

For the functional description of the Service Identifier Data Types, see chapter [7.9.17.1](#service-identifier-data-types). The data types described in this chapter are derived from the ara::com API design.

The serviceIdentifier is not visible in the ara::com API, as the specific service skeleton and proxy class itself represent the service type, but the serviceIdentifier is needed for the implementation of the Communication Management software. It is defined here to guarantee a minimum amount of information.

**[SWS_CM_01010]**{DRAFT} **Service Identifier and Service Contract Version** *[*The Communication Management shall provide a C++ class named ServiceInterface.shortName. The class contains at least a fully qualified name identifier (serviceIdentifier) , a service contract major (serviceContractVersionMajor) and minor (serviceContractVersionMinor) version number.

The exact type of serviceIdentifier is specific to the Communication Management software provider. Its concrete realization is implementation defined. To allow for logging and for storing and managing in C++ container classes by the using application, however, the type of the class shall satisfy the EqualityComparable requirements according to table 17, the LessThanComparable requirements according to table 18, and the CopyAssignable requirements according to table 23 of section 17.6.3.1 of [30]. These requirements are fulfilled if the operators operator==, operator\<, and operator= as well as a toString() method is provided.

```
1 class \<ServiceInterface.shortName\> {

2 public:

3 static const serviceIdentifierType serviceIdentifier;

4

5 static std::uint32_t serviceContractVersionMajor;

6 static std::uint32_t serviceContractVersionMinor;

7 };

8

9 class serviceIdentifierType {

10 bool operator==(const serviceIdentifierType& other) const;

11 bool operator\<(const serviceIdentifierType& other) const;

12 serviceIdentifierType& operator=(const serviceIdentifierType& other);

13 ara::core::StringView ToString() const;

14 };
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00200, RS_CM_00500)*

InstanceIdentifier or InstanceSpecifier are a necessary parameter of the API defined for both the skeleton and proxy side:

- on service skeleton side, it types the parameter needed to identify the service instance when creating an instance by [[SWS_CM_00130](#_bookmark525)],[[SWS_CM_00152](#_bookmark527)],[[SWS_CM_00153](#_bookmark529)].
- on service proxy side, it types the parameter needed to identify the service instance when searching for a specific instance by [[SWS_CM_00122](#_bookmark550)] or [[SWS_CM_00123](#_bookmark552)].

### [SWS_CM_00302] {DRAFT} Instance Identifier Class *[*

The Communication Management shall provide a class InstanceIdentifier. The definition of the InstanceIdentifier can be extended by the Communication Management software provider, but at least the given Named Constructor Create (), the class constructor and the class method signatures must be preserved. InstanceIdentifier shall further satisfy the EqualityComparable requirements according to table 17, the LessThanComparable requirements according to table 18, and the CopyAssignable requirements according to table 23 of section 17.6.3.1 of [30] to allow for logging of InstanceIdentifiers as well as storing and managing InstanceIdentifiers in C++ container classes by the using application. These requirements are fulfilled if the operators operator==, operator\<, and operator= as well as a ToString() method is provided.

The format of the string passed to the constructor, or returned by the ToString() method is specific to the Communication Management software provider, and not standardized.

In case the format of the string representation provided to Create() is corrupted, or not compliant to the software provider specification, an error code ComErrc::kInvalidInstanceIdentifierString shall be returned in the Result type.

The class constructor shall throw a ComException in case the format of the string provided is corrupted, or not compliant to the software provider specification.

```
1 class InstanceIdentifier {

2 public:

3

4 static ara::core::Result\<InstanceIdentifier\> Create(StringView serializedFormat) noexcept;

5 explicit InstanceIdentifier( ara::core::StringView serializedFormat);

6 ara::core::StringView ToString() const;

7 bool operator==(const InstanceIdentifier& other) const;

8 bool operator\<(const InstanceIdentifier& other) const;

9 InstanceIdentifier& operator=(const InstanceIdentifier& other);

10 };
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00101, RS_CM_00102, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00122, RS_AP_00127)*

**[SWS_CM_00319]**{DRAFT} **Instance Identifier Container Class** *[*The Communication Management shall provide the definition of a InstanceIdentifierContainer. The container holds a list of [render=InstanceIdentifier]ara::com::InstanceIdentifier. The assigned data type is allowed to be changed by the Communication Management software provider, but must adhere to the *general container requirements* according to table 96 of section 23.2.1 and the *sequence container requirements* according to table 100 of section 23.2.3 of [30]. A ara::core::Vector for example fulfills these requirements.

1 using InstanceIdentifierContainer = ara::core::Vector\<InstanceIdentifier\>;

*â™©(RS_CM_00101, RS_CM_00102, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00122)*

The following data types are used for the handling of services on the service consumer side, therefore they are part of the API defined for the proxy side.

**[SWS_CM_00303]**{DRAFT} **Find Service Handle** *[*The Communication Management shall provide the definition of an opaque FindServiceHandle with exactly this name. FindServiceHandle shall satisfy the EqualityComparable requirements according to table 17, the LessThanComparable requirements according to table 18, and the CopyAssignable requirements according to table 23 of section 17.6.3.1 of [30] to allow storing and managing FindServiceHandles in C++ container classes by the using application. These requirements are fulfilled if the following operators are provided: operator==, operator\<, and operator=. The exact definition of FindServiceHandle is communication management implementation specific.*â™©(RS_CM_00102, RS_AP_00122)*

For example, a definition of FindServiceHandle could look like this:

```
1 struct FindServiceHandle {

2 internal::ServiceId serviceIdentifier;

3 internal::InstanceId instanceIdentifier;

4 std::uint32_t uid;

5

6 bool operator==(const FindServiceHandle& other) const;

7 bool operator\<(const FindServiceHandle& other) const;

8 FindServiceHandle& operator=(const FindServiceHandle& other);

9 \...

10 };
```

**[SWS_CM_00312]**{DRAFT} **Handle Type Class** *[*The Communication Management shall provide the definition of HandleType. It types the handle for a specific service instance and shall contain the information that is needed to create a ServiceProxy. The definition of the HandleType can be extended by the Communication Management software provider, but at least the given class and class method signatures must be preserved.

HandleType shall satisfy the EqualityComparable requirements according to table 17 and the LessThanComparable requirements according to table 18 of section 17.6.3.1 of [30]. These requirements are fulfilled if the following operators are provided: operator== and operator\<. This, together with [[SWS_CM_00317](#_bookmark472)] and [[SWS_CM_00318](#_bookmark473)], allows storing and managing HandleTypes in C++ container classes by the using application.

The definition of the HandleType class shall be located inside the ServiceProxy class defined by [[SWS_CM_00004](#_bookmark516)]. This allows the Communication Management software to provide handles with different implementation dependent on the binding to the represented service.

```
1 class HandleType {

2 public:

3 bool operator==(const HandleType& other) const;

4 bool operator\<(const HandleType& other) const;

5 const ara::com::InstanceIdentifier& GetInstanceId() const;

6 };
```

*â™©(RS_CM_00102, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00122)*

Since the Communication Management software is responsible for creation of handles and the application just uses instances of it, the constructor signature is not part of the HandleType specification.

### Object Creation via Named Constructor Approach

The Named Constructor approach enables exception-less error reporting for object construction. Since service skeletons and service proxies can be created using a Named Constructor, this section describes the general requirements of this approach. For the service skeleton and service proxy creation C++ API reference, see chapter [8.1.3.3](#service-skeleton-creation-1) and [8.1.3.11](#service-proxy-creation-1), respectively.

**[SWS_CM_11326]**{DRAFT} **Creation of an object using Named Constructor approach** *[*The ClassToBeCreated shall provide a static member function Create() returning the constructed object embedded in an ara::core::Result. This function first performs all operations for constructing an object of ClassToBeCreated, which may fail or result in an error. E.g. parameter checks or resource allocation may fail. If an error occurs during these operations, the error is returned as an ara::core::ErrorCode in the ara::core::Result. If no error occurs, the created object is returned as a value in the ara::core::Result. The value object can then be considered as valid. The function shall not throw an exception.

static ara::core::Result\<ClassToBeCreated\> Create(/\* construction arguments \*/) noexcept;

Unless a potentially-throwing constructor shall be available for ClassToBeCreated, only the Create() function shall be public for the user. All regular constructors shall be private.*â™©(RS_CM_00101, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00139, RS_AP_00128, RS_AP_00132, RS_AP_00127, RS_AP_00139)*

If the offered service contains a Field that is defined with hasSetter=true, and no SetHandler has been registered yet, the service shall not be offered, and the error code ComErrc::kSetHandlerNotSet shall be returned in the Result type. See [[SWS_CM_00129](#_bookmark420)]*â™©(RS_CM_00101, RS_AP_00114, RS_AP_00120)*
